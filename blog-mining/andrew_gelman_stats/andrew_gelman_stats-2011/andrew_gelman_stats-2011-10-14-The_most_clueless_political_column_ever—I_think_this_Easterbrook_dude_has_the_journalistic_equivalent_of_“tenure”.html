It’s a bizarre mixture of cliches, non-sequitors, and outright mistakes.
 
The author is Gregg Easterbrook and he’s writing for  Reuters .
 
First, the cliches:
  
Right now Romney seems to be the frontrunner, which, of course, is a mixed blessing. His aura of experience and reasonableness could prove quite appealing to voters. Perry continues to have the potential to light a populist fire. . . . Of all the 2012 candidates, Huntsman is the one who is Not Just Another Politician.
  
And now the errors.
  
At this point in the 1992 election cycle, the elder George Bush held an 89 percent approval rating. . . . Clinton beat a popular incumbent with a fantastic approval rating. For the 2012 election, Barack Obama is just as vulnerable as the elder Bush, if not even more so. Obama currently has an approval rating of 23 percent.
  
This is all fine, except that:

</p><p>9 Bush’s highest approval rate  ever , and it was at the beginning of March 1991. [sent-33, score-0.32]
</p><p>10 As for Obama’s 23%, this comes from a Rasmussen report that Easterbrook  linked to  but misread:  28% “strongly approve” of Obama’s job performance but about 45% approve in total, according to Rasmussen’s own graph. [sent-34, score-0.119]
</p><p>11 Easterbrook is listed as “a contributing editor to The Atlantic, The New Republic and The Washington Monthly, a former visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and distinguished fellow of the Fulbright Foundation, and writes the Tuesday Morning Quarterback column for ESPN.

<p>Introduction: Dear Reuters editor:
 
Thanks for reading  my blog  and correcting the erroneous numbers in Easterbrook’s  column  from the other day.
 
I’m pretty sure you got the corrections from my blog because in your corrections you used  the exact same links  that I posted.  I think your readers will like that you gave links to the sources of your numbers.
 
But I’d appreciate if you cite me!  It’s considered polite to credit your sources rather than just copying over numbers and links with no mention of where they came from.  Unlike Easterbrook, I’m not expecting to be paid for this material but I’d still like to be thanked.
 
(See the last paragraph of  this post  by Felix Salmon for more on the desirability of linking to your sources.)
 
Also, since you’re correcting the article anyway, maybe you could go back and change this sentence too:
  
But don’t sell Huntsman short because he is low in the polls – Obama had been at that point, too.
  
As I noted earlier,

<p>Introduction: After I recently  criticized  Gregg Easterbrook for assigning Obama an implausible 90+% chance of beating Mitt Romney, some commenters thought I was being too critical, that I should cut Easterbrook some slack because he just was speaking metaphorically.
 
In other words, Easterbrook is a “qual.”  He uses numbers in his writing because that’s what everyone is supposed to do nowadays, but he doesn’t intend those numbers to be meant literally.  Similarly, he presumably didn’t really mean it when he  wrote  that Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren “couldn’t be more different — personally or politically.”  And he had no problem  typing  that Obama’s approval rating was 23% because, to him, “23%” is just another word for “low.”
 
He’s a qual, that’s all.
 
Similarly, when Samantha Power was just being a qual when she wrote the meaningful-sounding but actually empty statement, “Since 1968, with the single exception of the election of George W. Bush in 2000, Americans have chosen Republican pres</p><p>5 0.26364669 <a title="959-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-29-Giving_credit_where_due.html">1830 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-29-Giving credit where due</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gregg Easterbrook may not  always  be on the ball, but I 100% endorse the last section of his recent  column  (scroll down to “Absurd Specificity Watch”).

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
Bill Kristol notes that “Four presidents in the last century have won more than 51 percent of the vote twice: Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Reagan and Obama”. I’m not sure why Kristol, a conservative, is promoting the idea that Obama has a mandate, but that’s up to him. I’m more interested in the remarkable bit of cherry-picking that led to this “only four presidents” statistic.
 
There was one way in which Obama’s victory was large: he won the electoral college 332-206. That’s a thrashing. But if you want to claim that Obama has a “popular mandate” — which people seem to interpret as an overwhelming preference of The People such that the opposition is morally obligated to give way — you can’t make that argument based on the electoral college, you have to look at the popular vote. That presents you with a challenge for the 2012 election, since Obama’s 2.7-point margin in the popular vote was the 12th-smallest out of the 57 elections we’ve had.

<p>Introduction: Barack Obama’s win has a potentially huge effect on policy.  The current budget negotiations will affect the level and direction of government spending and on the mix of taxes paid by different groups of Americans.  We can guess that a President Romney would have fought hard against upper-income tax increases.  Other areas of long-term impact include the government’s stance on global warming, foreign policy, and the likelihood that Obama will nominate new Supreme Court justices who will uphold the right to abortion announced in Roe v. Wade. 


When it comes to public opinion, the story is different.  The Democrats may well benefit in 2014 and 2016 from the anticipated slow but steady recovery of the economy over the next few years—but, as of November 6, 2012, the parties are essentially tied, with Barack Obama receiving 51% of the two-party vote, compared to Mitt Romney’s 49%, a split comparable to Al Gore’s narrow victory in 2000, Richard Nixon’s in 1968, and John Kennedy’s in 1960.</p><p>5 0.79096419 <a title="959-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-26-The_quals_and_the_quants.html">1083 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-26-The quals and the quants</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After I recently  criticized  Gregg Easterbrook for assigning Obama an implausible 90+% chance of beating Mitt Romney, some commenters thought I was being too critical, that I should cut Easterbrook some slack because he just was speaking metaphorically.
 
In other words, Easterbrook is a “qual.”  He uses numbers in his writing because that’s what everyone is supposed to do nowadays, but he doesn’t intend those numbers to be meant literally.  Similarly, he presumably didn’t really mean it when he  wrote  that Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren “couldn’t be more different — personally or politically.”  And he had no problem  typing  that Obama’s approval rating was 23% because, to him, “23%” is just another word for “low.”
 
He’s a qual, that’s all.
 
Similarly, when Samantha Power was just being a qual when she wrote the meaningful-sounding but actually empty statement, “Since 1968, with the single exception of the election of George W. Bush in 2000, Americans have chosen Republican pres</p><p>6 0.79067779 <a title="959-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-20-A_qualified_but_incomplete_thanks_to_Gregg_Easterbrook%E2%80%99s_editor_at_Reuters.html">966 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-20-A qualified but incomplete thanks to Gregg Easterbrook’s editor at Reuters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I don’t know when I’ve seen political writing quote so misinformed as this. It’s a bizarre mixture of cliches, non-sequitors, and outright mistakes.
 
The author is Gregg Easterbrook and he’s writing for  Reuters .
 
First, the cliches:
  
Right now Romney seems to be the frontrunner, which, of course, is a mixed blessing. His aura of experience and reasonableness could prove quite appealing to voters. Perry continues to have the potential to light a populist fire. . . . Of all the 2012 candidates, Huntsman is the one who is Not Just Another Politician.
  
And now the errors.
  
At this point in the 1992 election cycle, the elder George Bush held an 89 percent approval rating. . . . Clinton beat a popular incumbent with a fantastic approval rating. For the 2012 election, Barack Obama is just as vulnerable as the elder Bush, if not even more so. Obama currently has an approval rating of 23 percent.
  
This is all fine, except that:

We are doing this because the road to the future of news has been littered with lost datasets. A day or so after every hackathon and meeting where a group has come together to analyze, compare and understand a particular set of data, someone tries to remember where the successful files were stored.

<p>Introduction: I’ve been blogging a lot lately about plagiarism (sorry, Bob!), and one thing that’s been bugging me is, why does it bother me so much.  Part of the story is simple:  much of my reputation comes from the words I write, so I bristle at any attempt to devalue words.  I feel the same way about plagiarism that a rich person would feel about counterfeiting:  Don’t debase my currency!
 
But it’s more than that.  After discussing this a bit with Thomas Basbøll, I realized that I’m bothered by the way that plagiarism interferes with the transmission of information:
  
Much has been written on the ethics of plagiarism. One aspect that has received less notice is plagiarism’s role in corrupting our ability to learn from data: We propose that plagiarism is a statistical crime. It involves the hiding of important information regarding the source and context of the copied work in its original form. Such information can dramatically alter the statistical inferences made about the work.

<p>Introduction: Red State Blue State:  How Will the U.S. Vote? 
 
It’s the “annual Halloween and pre-election extravaganza” of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and they suggested I could talk on the zombies paper (of course), but I thought the material on voting might be of more general interest.
 
The “How will the U.S. vote?” subtitle was not of my choosing, but I suppose I can add a few slides about the forthcoming election.
 
Fri 29 Oct 2010, 7pm in Ward I, in the basement of the Ward Circle building.
 
Should be fun.  I haven’t been to AU since taking a class there, over 30 years ago.
 
P.S.  It was indeed fun.   Here’s  the talk.  I did end up briefly describing my zombie research but it didn’t make it into any of the slides.</p><p>5 0.89182162 <a title="959-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-18-Prison_terms_for_financial_fraud%3F.html">420 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-18-Prison terms for financial fraud?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My econ dept colleague Joseph Stiglitz  suggests  that financial fraudsters be sent to prison.  He points out that the usual penalty–million-dollar fines–just isn’t enough for crimes whose rewards can be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
 
That all makes sense, but why do the options have to be:
 
1.  No punishment
 
2.  A fine with little punishment or deterrent value
 
3.  Prison. 
 
What’s the point of putting nonviolent criminals in prison?  As I’ve said  before , I’d prefer if the government just took all these convicted thieves’ assets along with 95% of their salary for several years, made them do community service (sorting bottles and cans at the local dump, perhaps; a financier should be good at this sort of thing, no?), etc. If restriction of personal freedom is judged be part of the sentence, they could be given some sort of electronic tag that would send a message to the police if you are ever more than 3 miles from your home.

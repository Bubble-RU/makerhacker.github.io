<p>Introduction: Yair points us to  this  page full of wonderful graphs from the Stephen Wolfram blog.  Here are a few:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
And some words:
  
People talk less about video games as they get older, and more about politics and the weather. Men typically talk more about sports and technology than women—and, somewhat surprisingly to me, they also talk more about movies, television and music. Women talk more about pets+animals, family+friends, relationships—and, at least after they reach child-bearing years, health. . . . Some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical. And most of it isn’t terribly surprising to anyone who’s known a reasonable diversity of people of different ages. But what to me is remarkable is how we can see everything laid out in such quantitative detail in the pictures above—kind of a signature of people’s thinking as they go through life. 


Of course, the pictures above are all based on aggregate data, carefully anonymized.

First, from “Alexa Russell,” subject line “An idea for a blog post: The Role, Importance, and Power of Words”:
  
Hi Andrew,


I’m a researcher/writer for a resource covering the importance of English proficiency in today’s workplace. I came across your blog andrewgelman.com as I was conducting research and I’m interested in contributing an article to your blog because I found the topics you cover very engaging.


I’m thinking about writing an article that looks at how the Internet has changed the way English is used today; not only has its syntax changed as a result of the Internet Revolution, but the amount of job opportunities has also shifted as a result of this shift. I’d be happy to work with you on the topic if you have any insights. Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Best, 
Alexa

I am in the process of choosing a textbook for a junior- or senior-level undergraduate two-semester sequence in probability and statistics.


I would be obliged if you could recommend one which is free (or at least cheap), or inquire with your blog readers for such a recommendation.


The course has been taught successfully in the past using Mathematical Statistics with Applications, by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer. Also at roughly the right level is Probability and Statistics by deGroot and Schervish.  However, the current edition of the first text now lists for $217, and I find myself embarrassed to ask students at a public university to pay prices at this level.


The main item on my wish list, other than the textbook being cheap and at the right level, is that it should be possible to teach the course by following the book closely for the entire year.

I teach a high school (grade 11) statistics class outside the USA and I am always looking for hands-on demonstrations.  In fact, last week (the start of our school year here), I did the in-class exercise about “guessing ages of ten pictures” (p. 11-13) from your  book  “Teaching Statistics – A Bag of Tricks”.


I am interested in using the “candy weighing”  demonstration  (p. 120-121) to talk about random sampling.


I agree with your advice (p.48, Sec 5.1) that it’s better to have students do sampling from actual populations.  I also agree with your suggestion that actual doing personal interviews is not an effective use of time, except for larger projects.


To that end, can you suggest some sources of actual population data that I could use in class?  As I am outside the USA (in Thailand), we do not have phonebooks here.  Certainly, this must soon be a problem for people in the USA with phonebooks going the way of the 8-track tape.

<p>Introduction: “Ethics and Statistics” is descriptive but boring.  It sounds like the textbook for a course which, unfortunately, nobody will take.
 
“Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics” is too unoriginal.
 
“How to Lie, Cheat, and Steal With Statistics” is kind of ok, maybe?
 
“Statistical Dilemmas”:  maybe a bit too boring as well.
 
“Knaves and Frauds of Statistics, and Some Guys Who’ve Skated a Bit Close to the Edge”:  Hmmm….
 
Maybe we have to get “statistics” out of the title altogether?
 
“Knaves and Frauds of Data Science”?
 
“Date Science and Data Fraud”?
 
“10 Things You Really Really Really Shouldn’t Do With Numbers”?
 
And, if no better idea comes along, there’s always “Evilicious:  Why We Evolved a Taste for Being Bad.”  (Regular readers will know what I’m talking about here; the rest of you can google it.)
 
Or maybe just “The Wegman Report”?
 
It’s  hard  to come up with a good title. Even  John Updike  had difficulties in this regard.

<p>Introduction: Xian pointed me to  this recycling  of a classic probability error.  It’s too bad it was in the New York Times, but at least it was in the Opinion Pages, so I guess that’s not so bad.  And, on the plus side, several of the blog commenters got the point.
 
What I was wondering, though, was who was this “Yitzhak Melechson, a statistics professor at the University of Tel Aviv”?  This is such a standard problem, I’m surprised to find a statistics professor making this mistake.  I was curious what his area of research is and where he was trained.
 
I started by googling Yitzhak Melechson but all I could find was this news story, over and over and over and over again.  Then I found Tel Aviv University and navigated to its statistics department but couldn’t find any Melechson in the faculty list.  Next stop:  entering Melechson in the search engine at the Tel Aviv University website.  It came up blank.
 
One last try:  I entered the Yitzhak Melechson into Google Scholar.

<p>Introduction: . . . and I decided to amuse myself by writing down all the management-speak words I heard:
 
“grappling” 
“early prototypes” 
“technology platform” 
“building block” 
“machine learning” 
“your team” 
“workspace” 
“tagging” 
“data exhaust” 
“monitoring a particular population” 
“collective intelligence” 
“communities of practice” 
“hackathon” 
“human resources . . . technologies”
 
Any one or two or three of these phrases might be fine, but put them all together and what you have is a festival of jargon.  A hackathon, indeed.</p><p>2 0.95791054 <a title="735-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-06-Statistical_inference_and_the_secret_ballot.html">1407 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-06-Statistical inference and the secret ballot</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ring Lardner, Jr.:
  
[In 1936] I was already settled in Southern California, and it may have been that first exercise of the franchise that triggered the FBI surveillance of me that would last for decades.  I had assumed, of course, that I was enjoying the vaunted American privilege of the secret ballot.  On a wall outside my polling place on Wilshire Boulevard, however, was a compilation of the district’s registered voters:  Democrats, a long list of names; Republicans, a somewhat lesser number; and “Declines to State,” one, “Ring W. Lardner, Jr.”  The day after the election, alongside those lists were published the results:  Roosevelt, so many; Landon, so many; Browder, one.</p><p>3 0.95090604 <a title="735-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-13-Indiemapper_makes_thematic_mapping_easy.html">206 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-13-Indiemapper makes thematic mapping easy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Kaiser  nails it .  The offending  article , by John Tierney, somehow ended up in the Science section rather than the Opinion section.  As an opinion piece (or, for that matter, a blog), Tierney’s article would be nothing special.  But I agree with Kaiser that it doesn’t work as a newspaper article.  As Kaiser notes, this story involves a bunch of statistical and empirical claims that are not well resolved by P.R. and rhetoric.</p><p>5 0.93402112 <a title="735-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-17-More_on_the_difficulty_of_%E2%80%9Cpreaching_what_you_practice%E2%80%9D.html">1325 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-17-More on the difficulty of “preaching what you practice”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple months ago, in discussing Charles Murray’s argument that America’s social leaders should “preach what they practice” (Murray argues that they—we!—tend to lead good lives of hard work and moderation but are all too tolerant of antisocial and unproductive behavior among the lower classes), I  wrote : 
  
  
Murray does not consider the case of Joe Paterno, but in many ways the Penn State football coach fits his story well. Paterno was said to live an exemplary personal and professional life, combining traditional morality with football success—but, by his actions, he showed little concern about the morality of his players and coaches. At a professional level, Paterno rose higher and higher, and in his personal life he was a responsible adult. But he had an increasing disconnect with the real world, to the extent that horrible crimes were occurring nearby (in the physical and social senses) but he was completely insulated from the consequences for many years. Paterno’s story is s</p><p>6 0.9320457 <a title="735-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-02-The_winner%E2%80%99s_curse.html">310 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-02-The winner’s curse</a></p>

</p><p>4 I don’t find it plausible that I can double the odds that my daughter will marry an Andrew if I renamed her Andrea. [sent-7, score-0.414]

</p><p>7 (R-squared question) then I am with you, even the most naïve estimates which will grossly over-estimate its potential impact will lead to tiny r-square effects. [sent-11, score-0.173]
</p><p>8 Although with that logic not wearing seat belts may not be that bad, since most people don’t have serious accidents and hence the change in likelihood of dying, even if twice as likely, is still pretty slim. [sent-12, score-1.172]
</p><p>9 To which I replied:   I actually think that the effect sized are plausible (even if they’re perhaps not real). [sent-14, score-0.392]
</p><p>10 For example, marrying a Smith is pretty rare, so even a small boost in that direction could be a large factor. [sent-15, score-0.394]
</p><p>11 From a statistical point of view, though, knowing that something is a small effect is also telling us that it will be difficult to study. [sent-16, score-0.421]
</p><p>12 Finally, yes, I agree that not wearing seat belts is not that bad, since indeed it is unlikely to kill or seriously injure you. [sent-17, score-0.838]
</p><p>13 On the other hand, seat belts don’t cause much discomfort, so the cost-benefit decision for me is to wear them (during the rare times that I’m riding in a car or plane). [sent-18, score-0.983]
</p><p>14 And from a public health standpoint, seat belts are a cheap and uncontroversial way to save thousands of lives. [sent-19, score-0.712]
</p><p>15 I even wear a bike helmet, which is a lot more of an irritant than wearing seat belts. [sent-20, score-0.813]
</p><p>16 Then again, I have a friend who fell when riding without a helmet and suffered a serious brain injury. [sent-21, score-0.445]
</p><p>17 Simonsohn then shot back:    I think we need a benchmark to make a more informed judgment if the effect is small or large. [sent-22, score-0.423]
</p><p>18 For example, the Dennis/dentist effect should be much smaller than parent-dentist/child-dentist. [sent-23, score-0.229]
</p><p>19 The J marries J effect should not be much larger than the effect of, say, conditioning on going to the same high-school, having sat next to each other in class for a whole semester. [sent-25, score-0.544]

- People’s names affect where they live, what jobs they take, etc. 
- Beautiful people are more likely to have girl babies 
- More attractive instructors have higher teaching evaluations 
- In a basketball game, it’s better to be behind by a point at halftime than to be ahead by a point 
- Praying for someone without their knowledge improves their recovery from heart attacks 
- A variety of claims about ESP
 
How should we think about these claims?  The usual approach is to evaluate the statistical evidence–in particular, to look for reasons that the claimed results are not really statistically significant.  If nobody can shoot down a claim, it survives.

Uri Simonsohn (the author of the recent rebuttal of the name-choice article by Pelham et al.) argued that the implied effects were too large to be believed (just as I was arguing above regarding the July 4th study), which makes more plausible his claims that the results arise from methodological artifacts.

<p>Introduction: Devah Pager points me to  this article  by Uri Simonsohn, which begins:
  
Three articles published [by Brett Pelham et al.] have shown that a disproportionate share of people choose spouses, places to live, and occupations with names similar to their own. These findings, interpreted as evidence of implicit egotism, are included in most modern social psychology textbooks and many university courses. The current article successfully replicates the original findings but shows that they are most likely caused by a combination of cohort, geographic, and ethnic confounds as well as reverse causality.
  
From Simonsohn’s article, here’s a handy summary of the claims and the evidence (click on it to enlarge):
 
   
 
The Pelham et al. articles have come up several times on the blog, starting with  this discussion  and  this estimate  and then more recently  here .  I’m curious what Pelham and his collaborators think of Simonsohn’s claims.</p><p>5 0.15289788 <a title="629-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-02-Blending_results_from_two_relatively_independent_multi-level_models.html">250 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-02-Blending results from two relatively independent multi-level models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Shor writes:
  
 
I [Shor] am working on a Bayesian Forecasting model for the Mid-term elections that has two components:


1) A poll aggregation system with pooled and hierarchical house and design effects across every race with polls (Average Standard error for house seat level vote-share ~.055)


2) A Bafumi-style regression that applies national-swing to individual seats. (Average Standard error for house seat level vote-share ~.06)


Since these two estimates are essentially independent, estimates can probably be made more accurate by pooling them together. But If a house effect changes in one draw, that changes estimates in every race. Changes in regression coefficients and National swing have a similar effect.  In the face of high and possibly differing seat-to-seat correlations from each method, I’m not sure what the correct way to “blend” these models would be, either for individual or top-line seat estimates.

<p>Introduction: Josef Fruehwald  writes :
  
In the past few years, the empirical foundations of the social sciences, especially Psychology, have been coming under increased scrutiny and criticism. For example, there was the New Yorker piece from 2010 called “The Truth Wears Off” about the “decline effect,” or how the effect size of a phenomenon appears to decrease over time. . . .


I [Fruehwald] am a linguist. Do the problems facing psychology face me? To really answer that, I first have to decide which explanation for the decline effect I think is most likely, and I think Andrew Gelman’s proposal is a good candidate:

 
The short story is that if you screen for statistical significance when estimating small effects, you will necessarily overestimate the magnitudes of effects, sometimes by a huge amount.

<p>Introduction: Jeff Leek  just posted  the discussions of his paper (with Leah Jager), “An estimate of the science-wise false discovery rate and application to the top medical literature,” along with some further comments of his own.
 
 Here  are my original thoughts on an earlier version of their article.  Keith O’Rourke and I expanded these thoughts into  a formal comment  for the journal.  We’re pretty much in agreement with John Ioannidis (you can find his discussion in the top link above).
 
In quick summary, I agree with Jager and Leek that this is an important topic.  I think there are two key places where Keith and I disagree with them:
 
1.  They take published p-values at face value whereas we consider them as the result of a complicated process of selection.  This is something I didn’t used to think much about, but now I’ve become increasingly convinced that the problems with published p-values is not a simple file-drawer effect or the case of a few p=0.051 values nudged toward p=0.049, bu</p><p>6 0.80322611 <a title="629-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-24-%E2%80%9CEdlin%E2%80%99s_rule%E2%80%9D_for_routinely_scaling_down_published_estimates.html">2223 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-24-“Edlin’s rule” for routinely scaling down published estimates</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Loren Maxwell writes: 
  
  
I am trying to do some studies on the  PageRank algorithm  with applying a Bayesian technique.  If you are not familiar with PageRank, it is the basis for how Google ranks their pages.  It basically treats the internet as a large social network with each link conferring some value onto the page it links to.  For example, if I had a webpage that had only one link to it, say from my friend’s webpage, then its PageRank would be dependent on my friend’s PageRank, presumably quite low.  However, if the one link to my page was off the Google search page, then my PageRank would be quite high since there are undoubtedly millions of pages linking to Google and few pages that Google links to.


The end result of the algorithm, however, is that all the PageRank values of the nodes in the network sum to one and the PageRank of a specific node is the probability that a “random surfer” will end up on that node.


For example, in the attached spreadsheet, Column D shows e</p><p>same-blog 3 0.92904961 <a title="629-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-26-Is_it_plausible_that_1%25_of_people_pick_a_career_based_on_their_first_name%3F.html">629 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-26-Is it plausible that 1% of people pick a career based on their first name?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In my discussion of dentists-named-Dennis study, I referred to my back-of-the-envelope  calculation  that the effect (if it indeed exists) corresponds to an approximate 1% aggregate chance that you’ll pick a profession based on your first name.  Even if there are nearly twice as many dentist Dennises as would be expected from chance alone, the base rate is so low that a shift of 1% of all Dennises would be enough to do this.  My point was that (a) even a small effect could show up when looking at low-frequency events such as the choice to pick a particular career or live in a particular city, and (b) any small effects will inherently be difficult to detect in any direct way.

WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION


The Workshop for Women in Machine Learning is a day-long event taking place on the first day of NIPS. 
The workshop aims to showcase the research of women in machine learning and to strengthen their community. 
The event brings together female faculty, graduate students, and research scientists for an opportunity to connect, exchange ideas, and learn from each other. Underrepresented minorities and undergraduates interested in pursuing machine learning research are encouraged to participate. While all presenters will be female, all genders are invited to attend.


Scholarships will be provided to female students and postdoctoral attendees with accepted abstracts to partially offset travel costs.

<p>Introduction: At  GetTheData , you can ask and answer data related questions. Here’s a preview:   
 
I’m not sure a Q&A; site is the best way to do this. 
 
My pipe dream is to create a taxonomy of variables and instances, and collect spreadsheets annotated this way. Imagine doing a search of type: “give me datasets, where an instance is a person, the variables are age, gender and weight” – and out would come datasets, each one tagged with the descriptions of the variables that were held constant for the whole dataset (person_type=student, location=Columbia, time_of_study=1/1/2009, study_type=longitudinal). It would even be possible to automatically convert one variable into another, if it was necessary (like age = time_of_measurement-time_of_birth). Maybe the dream of  Semantic Web  will actually be implemented for relatively structured statistical data rather than much fuzzier “knowledge”, just consider the difficulties of developing a universal  Freebase .

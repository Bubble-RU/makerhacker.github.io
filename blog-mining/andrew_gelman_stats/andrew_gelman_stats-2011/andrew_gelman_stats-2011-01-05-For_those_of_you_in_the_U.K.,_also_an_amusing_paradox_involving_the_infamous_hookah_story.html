Doubtful.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The (U.S.) “President’s Cancer Panel” has released its 2008-2009 annual report, which includes a cover letter that says “the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.”  The report itself discusses exposures to various types of industrial chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens, in some detail, but gives nearly no data or analysis to suggest that these exposures are contributing to significant numbers of cancers.  In fact, there is pretty good evidence that they are not. 
 
 
  

 
The plot above shows age-adjusted cancer mortality for men, by cancer type, in the U.S.  The plot below shows the same for women.  In both cases, the cancers with the highest mortality rates are shown, but not all cancers (e.g. brain cancer is not shown).  For what it’s worth, I’m not sure how trustworthy the rates are from the 1930s — it seems possible that reporting, autopsies, or both, were less careful during the Great Depression — so I suggest focusing on the r</p><p>3 0.1365907 <a title="504-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-02-%E2%80%9CIf_our_product_is_harmful_._._._we%E2%80%99ll_stop_making_it.%E2%80%9D.html">1480 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-02-“If our product is harmful . . . we’ll stop making it.”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After our  discussion  of the sad case of Darrell Huff, the celebrated “How to Lie with Statistics” guy who had a lucrative side career disparaging the link between smoking and cancer, I was motivated to follow John Mashey’s  recommendation  and read the book, Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition, by historian Robert Proctor.
 
My first stop upon receiving the book was the index, in particular the entry for  Rubin, Donald B.   I followed the reference to pages 440-442 and found the description of Don’s activities to be accurate, neither diminished nor overstated, to the best of my knowledge.
 
Rubin is the second-most-famous statistician to have been paid by the cigarette industry, but several other big and small names have been on the payroll at one time or another.  Here’s a partial  list .  Just including the people I know or have heard of:

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>5 0.099189453 <a title="504-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-19-Is_coffee_a_killer%3F__I_don%E2%80%99t_think_the_effect_is_as_high_as_was_estimated_from_the_highest_number_that_came_out_of_a_noisy_study.html">2030 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-19-Is coffee a killer?

 The Herald  has a story about hazards of coffee. The picture caption says

 
 Men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die. 
 

which is obviously not true: deaths, as we’ve observed before, are fixed at one per customer.  The story says

 
 It’s not that people are dying at a rapid rate. But men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die and women have double the chance compared with moderate drinkers, according to the The University of Queensland and the University of South Carolina study. 
 

What  the study  actually reported was rates of death: over an average of 17 years, men who drink more than four cups a day died at about a 21% higher rate, with little evidence of any difference in men.  After they considered only men and women under 55 (which they don’t say was something they had planned to do), and attempted to control for a whole bunch of other factors, the rate increase went to 56% for me</p><p>6 0.088389181 <a title="504-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-01-A_lifetime_supply_of_._._..html">1601 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-01-A lifetime supply of . . .</a></p>

Forget the interpretation for a moment, and the political spin, but haven’t we reached an interesting point when a journalist says things like:

 
When you do an RCT with more than 12,000 people in it, and your defense of your hypothesis is that maybe the study just didn’t have enough power, what you’re actually saying is “the beneficial effects are probably pretty small”.
 

and

 
A good Bayesian—and aren’t most of us are supposed to be good Bayesians these days?—should be updating in light of this new information. Given this result, what is the likelihood that Obamacare will have a positive impact on the average health of Americans? Every one of us, for or against, should be revising that probability downwards. I’m not saying that you have to revise it to zero; I certainly haven’t. But however high it was yesterday, it should be somewhat lower today.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
An Oregon legislator, Mitch Greenlick, has  proposed to make it illegal  in Oregon to carry a child under six years old on one’s bike (including in a child seat) or in a bike trailer.  The guy says “”We’ve just done a study showing that 30 percent of riders biking to work at least three days a week have some sort of crash that leads to an injury… When that’s going on out there, what happens when you have a four year old on the back of a bike?”  The study is from Oregon Health Sciences University, at which the legislator is a professor. 
 
Greenlick also says “”If it’s true that it’s unsafe, we have an obligation to protect people. If I thought a law would save one child’s life, I would step in and do it. Wouldn’t you?”
 
There are two statistical issues here.  The first is in the category of “lies, damn lies, and statistics,” and involves the statement about how many riders have injuries.  As quoted on  a blog ,  the author of the study in question says th</p><p>4 0.78059477 <a title="504-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-19-Is_coffee_a_killer%3F__I_don%E2%80%99t_think_the_effect_is_as_high_as_was_estimated_from_the_highest_number_that_came_out_of_a_noisy_study.html">2030 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-19-Is coffee a killer?

 Men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die. 
 

which is obviously not true: deaths, as we’ve observed before, are fixed at one per customer.  The story says

 
 It’s not that people are dying at a rapid rate. But men who drink more than four cups a day are 56 per cent more likely to die and women have double the chance compared with moderate drinkers, according to the The University of Queensland and the University of South Carolina study. 
 

What  the study  actually reported was rates of death: over an average of 17 years, men who drink more than four cups a day died at about a 21% higher rate, with little evidence of any difference in men.  After they considered only men and women under 55 (which they don’t say was something they had planned to do), and attempted to control for a whole bunch of other factors, the rate increase went to 56% for me</p><p>5 0.77983767 <a title="504-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-03-On_house_arrest_for_p-hacking.html">2049 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-03-On house arrest for p-hacking</a></p>
<p>Introduction: People keep pointing me to  this  excellent news article by David Brown, about a scientist who was convicted of data manipulation:
  
In all, 330 patients were randomly assigned to get either interferon gamma-1b or placebo injections. Disease progression or death occurred in 46 percent of those on the drug and 52 percent of those on placebo. That was not a significant difference, statistically speaking. When only survival was considered, however, the drug looked better: 10 percent of people getting the drug died, compared with 17 percent of those on placebo. However, that difference wasn’t “statistically significant,” either.


Specifically, the so-called P value — a mathematical measure of the strength of the evidence that there’s a true difference between a treatment and placebo — was 0.08. . . . Technically, the study was a bust, although the results leaned toward a benefit from interferon gamma-1b. Was there a group of patients in which the results tipped?

<p>Introduction: In the annals of hack literature, it is sometimes said that if you aim to write best-selling crap, all you’ll end up with is crap.  To truly produce best-selling crap, you have to have a conviction, perhaps misplaced, that your writing has integrity.  Whether or not this is a good generalization about writing, I have seen an analogous phenomenon in statistics:  If you try to do nothing but model the data, you can be in for a wild and unpleasant ride:  real data always seem to have one more twist beyond our ability to model (von Neumann’s elephant’s trunk notwithstanding).  But if you model the underlying process, sometimes your model can fit surprisingly well as well as inviting openings for future research progress.</p><p>2 0.94427627 <a title="504-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-31-Snotty_reviewers.html">1700 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-31-Snotty reviewers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a submission a couple years ago that was rejected by a journal.  One of the reviewers began with the following snotty aside:
  
In this manuscript Gelman and Shalizi (there’s no anonymity here; this thing has been floating around the web for some time) . . .
  
Actually, we posted it on the same day we submitted it to the journal.  But double-blindness allowed the reviewer to act as if we had done something wrong!  And, even if it  had  been “floating around the web for some time,” that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  Perhaps it just meant that the article had previously been rejected by a bad-attitude reviewer!</p><p>3 0.93829972 <a title="504-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-28-Every_time_you_take_a_sample%2C_you%E2%80%99ll_have_to_pay_this_guy_a_quarter.html">1398 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-28-Every time you take a sample, you’ll have to pay this guy a quarter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Roy Mendelssohn pointed me to  this  heartwarming story of Jay Vadiveloo, an actuary who got a patent for the idea of statistical sampling.  Vadiveloo writes, “the results were astounding: statistical sampling worked.”
 
You may laugh, but wait till Albedo Man buys the patent and makes everybody do his bidding.  They’re gonna dig up Laplace and make him pay retroactive royalties.  And somehow Clippy will get involved in all this.
 
P.S.  Mendelssohn writes:  “Yes, I felt it was a heartwarming story also.  Perhaps we can get a patent for regression.”
 
I say, forget a patent for regression.  I want a patent for the sample mean.  That’s where the real money is.  You can’t charge a lot for each use, but consider the volume!</p><p>4 0.9335379 <a title="504-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-01-Lamentably_common_misunderstanding_of_meritocracy.html">1037 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-01-Lamentably common misunderstanding of meritocracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  pointed  to  an article  by business-school professor Luigi Zingales about meritocracy.  I’d expect a b-school prof to support the idea of meritocracy, and Zingales does not disappoint.
 
But he says a bunch of other things that to me represent a confused conflation of ideas.  Here’s Zingales:
  
America became known as a land of opportunity—a place whose capitalist system benefited  the hardworking and the virtuous  [emphasis added]. In a word, it was a meritocracy.
  
That’s interesting—and revealing.  Here’s what I get when I look up “meritocracy” in the  dictionary :
  
1 : a system in which the talented are chosen and moved ahead on the basis of their achievement 
2 : leadership selected on the basis of intellectual criteria
  
Nothing here about “hardworking” or “virtuous.”  In a meritocracy, you can be as hardworking as John Kruk or as virtuous as Kobe Bryant and you’ll still get ahead—if you have the talent and achievement.  Throwing in “hardworking” and “virtuous”</p><p>same-blog 5 0.92877406 <a title="504-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-05-For_those_of_you_in_the_U.K.%2C_also_an_amusing_paradox_involving_the_infamous_hookah_story.html">504 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-05-For those of you in the U.K., also an amusing paradox involving the infamous hookah story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ll be on Radio 4 at 8.40am, on the BBC show “Today,” talking about  The Honest Rainmaker .  I have no idea how the interview went (it was about 5 minutes), but I’m kicking myself because I was planning to tell the hookah story, but I forgot.  Here it is:
  
I was at a panel for the National Institutes of Health evaluating grants. One of the proposals had to do with the study of the effect of water-pipe smoking, the hookah. There was a discussion around the table. The NIH is a United States government organisation; not many people in the US really smoke hookahs; so should we fund it? Someone said, ‘Well actually it’s becoming more popular among the young.’ And if younger people smoke it, they have a longer lifetime exposure, and apparently there is some evidence that the dose you get of carcinogens from hookah smoking might be 20 times the dose of smoking a cigarette. I don’t know the details of the math, but it was a lot. So even if not many people do it, if you multiply the risk, yo</p><p>6 0.92617047 <a title="504-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-Drug_testing_for_recipents_of_NSF_and_NIH_grants%3F.html">92 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-Drug testing for recipents of NSF and NIH grants?</a></p>

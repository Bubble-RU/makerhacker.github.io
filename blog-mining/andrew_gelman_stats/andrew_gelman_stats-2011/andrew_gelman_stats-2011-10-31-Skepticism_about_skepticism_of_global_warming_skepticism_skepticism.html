<p>Introduction: I. State of the Climate report   
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently released their  “State of the Climate Report” for 2009 .  The report has chapters discussing global climate (temperatures, water vapor, cloudiness, alpine glaciers,…); oceans (ocean heat content, sea level, sea surface temperatures, etc.); the arctic (sea ice extent, permafrost, vegetation, and so on); Antarctica (weather observations, sea ice extent,…), and regional climates. 
 
NOAA also provides  a nice page  that lets you display any of 11 relevant time-series datasets (land-surface air temperature, sea level, ocean heat content, September arctic sea-ice extent, sea-surface temperature, northern hemisphere snow cover, specific humidity, glacier mass balance, marine air temperature, tropospheric temperature, and stratospheric temperature).

<p>Introduction: My friend Seth, whom I know from Berkeley (we taught a course together on left-handedness), has a blog on topics ranging from thoughtful  discussions  of scientific evidence, to  experiences  with his unconventional weight-loss scheme,  offbeat  self-experimentation, and advocacy of  fringe  scientific theories, leavened with occasional dollops of  cynicism  and political  extremism .  I agree with Seth on  some  things but not others.  ( Here’s  Seth’s reason for not attempting a clinical trial of his diet.)
 
Recently I was disturbed (but, I’m sorry to say, not surprised) to see Seth  post  the following:
  
 Predictions of climate models versus reality . I [Seth] have only seen careful prediction-vs-reality comparisons made by AGW [anthropogenic global warming] skeptics. Those who believe humans are dangerously warming the planet appear to be silent on this subject.

<p>Introduction: Hear me interviewed on the topic  here .
 
P.S.  The interview was fine but I donâ&euro;&trade;t agree with everything on the linked website.  For example,  this  bit:
  
Global warming is not the first case of a widespread fear based on incomplete knowledge turned out to be false or at least greatly exaggerated.  Global warming has many of the characteristics of a popular delusion, an irrational fear or cause that is embraced by millions of people because, well, it is believed by millions of people!
  
All right, then.</p><p>5 0.15788662 <a title="983-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-07-Inference_%3D_data_%2B_model.html">1201 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-07-Inference = data + model</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  recent article  on global warming reminded me of the difficulty of letting the data speak.  William Nordhaus shows the following graph: 
   
   
 
And then he writes:
  
One of the reasons that drawing conclusions on temperature trends is tricky is that the historical temperature series is highly volatile, as can be seen in the figure. The presence of short-term volatility requires looking at long-term trends. A useful analogy is the stock market. Suppose an analyst says that because real stock prices have declined over the last decade (which is true), it follows that there is no upward trend. Here again, an examination of the long-term data would quickly show this to be incorrect. The last decade of temperature and stock market data is not representative of the longer-term trends.


The finding that global temperatures are rising over the last century-plus is one of the most robust findings of climate science and statistics.

Well, I think I’ve found the answer in  this article  by John Lanchester:

<p>Introduction: I came across  a document  [updated link  here ], “Applying structured analogies to the global warming alarm movement,” by Kesten Green and Scott Armstrong.  The general approach is appealing to me, but the execution seemed disturbingly flawed.
 
Here’s how they introduce the project:
  
The structured analogies procedure we [Green and Armstrong] used for this study was as follows:


1. Identify possible analogies by searching the literature and by asking experts with different viewpoints to nominate analogies to the target situation: alarm over dangerous manmade global warming. 
2. Screen the possible analogies to ensure they meet the stated criteria and that the outcomes are known. 
3. Code the relevant characteristics of the analogous situations. 
4. Forecast target situation outcomes by using a predetermined mechanical rule to select the outcomes of the analogies. 
Here is how we posed the question to the experts:

<p>Introduction: David Hogg pointed me to  this news article  by Angela Saini: 
  
  
It’s not often that the quiet world of mathematics is rocked by a murder case. But last summer saw a trial that sent academics into a tailspin, and has since swollen into a fevered clash between science and the law.


At its heart, this is a story about chance. And it begins with a convicted killer, “T”, who took his case to the court of appeal in 2010. Among the evidence against him was a shoeprint from a pair of Nike trainers, which seemed to match a pair found at his home. While appeals often unmask shaky evidence, this was different. This time, a mathematical formula was thrown out of court. The footwear expert made what the judge believed were poor calculations about the likelihood of the match, compounded by a bad explanation of how he reached his opinion. The conviction was quashed. . . .


“The impact will be quite shattering,” says Professor Norman Fenton, a mathematician at Queen Mary, University of London.</p><p>2 0.97708046 <a title="983-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-13-Randomized_experiments%2C_non-randomized_experiments%2C_and_observational_studies.html">340 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-13-Randomized experiments, non-randomized experiments, and observational studies</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John Mashey sends me this delightful video (not in English but it has subtitles) from the University of Bergen (link comes from  this page  from Elsevier but I don’t see any direct connection between the controversial academic publisher and the Bergen group).
 
Part of me believes, deep down, that if someone were to send this link to  Edward Wegman , he will repent, that he’ll just break down, confess, and apologize to everybody involved.
 
I can’t understand the psychology of such people.  I mean, I can understand someone being lazy enough to plagiarize and to deny if accused.  But to keep denying after you’ve been caught and everyone knows you did it—I simply can’t see how someone can do that.
 
But this surely reflects my nerd-like lack of understanding of human nature, more than anything else.  It’s a bit scary that someone such as myself who has such poor intuitions about human behavior can become a prominent social scientist, but I suppose it takes all kinds.

<p>Introduction: I was  unsurprised  to read that Lou Dobbs, the former CNN host who crusaded against illegal immigrants, had actually hired a bunch of them himself to maintain his large house and his horse farm.  (OK, I have to admit I was surprised by the part about the horse farm.)
 
But I think most of the reactions to this story missed the point. Isabel Macdonald’s  article  that broke the story was entitled, “Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite,” and most of the  discussion  went from there, with some commenters piling on Dobbs and others defending him by saying that Dobbs hired his laborers through contractors and may not have known they were in the country illegally.
 
To me, though, the key issue is slightly different.  And Macdonald’s story is relevant whether or not Dobbs knew he was hiring illegals.  My point is not that Dobbs is a bad guy, or a hypocrite, or whatever.  My point is that, in his setting, it would take an extraordinary effort to not hire illegal immigrants to take care of his house</p><p>5 0.97347152 <a title="983-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-06-Another_stereotype_demolished.html">699 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-06-Another stereotype demolished</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve heard from various sources that when you give a talk in an econ dept that they eat you alive:  typically the audience showers you with questions and you are lucky to get past the second slide in your presentation.  So far, though, I’ve given seminar talks in three economics departments–George Mason University a few years ago, Sciences Po last year, and Hunter College yesterday–and all three times the audiences have been completely normal.  They did not interrupt unduly and they asked a bunch of good questions at the end.  n=3, sure.  But still.</p><p>6 0.97030306 <a title="983-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-31-Using_factor_analysis_or_principal_components_analysis_or_measurement-error_models_for_biological_measurements_in_archaeology%3F.html">1094 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-31-Using factor analysis or principal components analysis or measurement-error models for biological measurements in archaeology?</a></p>

I know you’ve discussed this on your blog in the past, but I don’t know exactly how you’d answer the following query:


Suppose you run an analysis and obtain a p-value of 10^-300.  What would you actually report?  I’m fairly confident that I’m not that confident :) I’m guessing: “p-value \approx 0.”


One possibility is to determine the accuracy with this one *could* in theory know, by virtue of the sample size, and say that p-value is less than or equal to that?  For example, if I used a Monte Carlo approach to generate the null distribution with 10,000 samples, and I found that the observed value was more extreme than all of the sample values, then I might say that p is less than or equal to 1/10,000.

  
My reply:  Mosteller and Wallace talked a bit about this in their book, the idea that there are various other 1-in-a-million possibilities (for example, the data were faked somewhere before they got to you) so p-values such as 10^-6 don’t really mean an</p><p>3 0.080398843 <a title="1058-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-27-%E2%80%9CApple_confronts_the_law_of_large_numbers%E2%80%9D_._._._huh%3F.html">1187 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-27-“Apple confronts the law of large numbers” . . . huh?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was reading this  news article  by famed business reporter James Stewart: 
  
  
Measured by market capitalization, Apple is the world’s biggest public company. . . . Sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 . . . totaled $46.33 billion, up 73 percent from the year before. Earnings more than doubled. . . . Here is the rub: Apple is so big, it’s running up against the law of large numbers.
  
Huh?  At this point I sat up, curious.  Stewart continued:
  
Also known as the golden theorem, with a proof attributed to the 17th-century Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli, the law states that a variable will revert to a mean over a large sample of results. In the case of the largest companies, it suggests that high earnings growth and a rapid rise in share price will slow as those companies grow ever larger.


If Apple’s share price grew even 20 percent a year for the next decade, which is far below its current blistering pace, its $500 billion market capitalization would be more than $3 tri</p><p>4 0.070738643 <a title="1058-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-09-Difficulties_with_Bayesian_model_averaging.html">754 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-09-Difficulties with Bayesian model averaging</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In response to  this article  by Cosma Shalizi and myself on the philosophy of Bayesian statistics, David Hogg writes:
  
I [Hogg] agree–even in physics and astronomy–that the models are not “True” in the God-like sense of being absolute reality (that is, I am not a realist); and I  have argued  (a philosophically very naive 
paper, but hey, I was new to all this) that for pretty fundamental reasons we could never arrive at the True (with a capital “T”) model of the Universe.  The goal of inference is to find the “best” model, where “best” might have something to do with prediction, or explanation, or message length, or (horror!) our utility.  Needless to say, most of my physics friends *are* realists, even in the face of “effective theories” as Newtonian mechanics is an effective theory of GR and GR is an effective theory of “quantum gravity” (this plays to your point, because if you think any theory is possibly an effective theory, how could you ever find Truth?).

<p>Introduction: You know that expression, “Not from the Onion”?  How did we say that, all those years before the Onion existed?
 
I was thinking about this after encountering (amidst a Google search for something else)  this article  on a website called “College News”:
  
DANVILLE, KY., March 8, 2007–Two Centre College professors spent the past six years reading and analyzing 200 children’s books to discover a disturbing trend: gender bias still exists in much of modern children’s literature.


Dr. David Anderson, professor of economics, and Dr. Mykol Hamilton, professor of psychology, have documented that gender bias is common today in many children’s books in their research published recently in Sex Roles: A Journal of Research titled “Gender Stereotyping and Under-Representation of Female Characters in 200 Popular Children’s Picture Books: A 21st Century Update.” . . .

<p>Introduction: A moviegoing colleague writes:
  
I just watched the movie Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.  What struck me about it was: (1) Bayes theorem underlies the whole movie; (2) CIA top brass do not know Bayes theorem (at least as portrayed in the movie).


Obviously one does not need to know physics to play billiards, but it helps with the reasoning.


Essentially, at some point the key CIA agent locates what she strongly believes is OBL’s hidding place in Pakistan.  Then it takes the White House some 150 days to make the decision to attack the compound.  Why so long? And why, even on the eve of the operation, were senior brass only some 60% OBL was there?  


Fear of false positives is the answer.  After all, the compound could belong to a drug lord, or some other terrorist.  Here is the math:


There are two possibilities, according to movie: OBL is in a compound (C) in a city or he is in the mountains in tribal regions.  Say P(OBL in C) = 0.5.

<p>Introduction: Sharad  explains :
  
HIV/AIDS, like many other contagious diseases, exemplifies the common view of so-called viral propagation, growing from a few initial cases to millions through close person-to-person interactions. (Ironically, not all viruses in fact exhibit “viral” transmission patterns. For example, Hepatitis A often spreads through contaminated drinking water.[1]) By analogy to such biological epidemics, the diffusion of products and ideas is conventionally assumed to occur “virally” as well, as evidenced by prevailing theoretical frameworks (e.g., the cascade and threshold models) and an obsession in the marketing world for all things social. . . .


Despite hundreds of papers written about diffusion, there is surprisingly little work addressing this fundamental empirical question.


In a recent study, Duncan Watts, Dan Goldstein, and I [Goel] examined the adoption patterns of several different types of products diffusing over various online platforms — including Twitter, Face</p><p>5 0.71346867 <a title="1058-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-28-Brow_inflation.html">489 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-28-Brow inflation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In an article headlined, “Hollywood moves away from middlebrow,” Brooks Barnes  writes :
  
As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like “The Wolfman” and “The A-Team”; star vehicles like “Killers” with Ashton Kutcher and “The Tourist” with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like “Sex and the City 2.” All arrived at theaters with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film. . . .


But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped. Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. “Inception,” a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; “The Social Network” has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. . . . the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enoug</p><p>6 0.71027941 <a title="1058-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-04-A_Wikipedia_whitewash.html">69 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-04-A Wikipedia whitewash</a></p>

<p>Introduction: According to  Chris Wilson , there are two versions of the report of the Occupy Wall Street poll from  so-called  hack pollster Doug Schoen.
 
 Here’s  the report that Azi Paybarah says that Schoen sent to him, and here’s the final question from the poll:
 
   
 
And here’s what’s on Schoen’s  own  website: 
   
 
Very similar, except for that last phrase, “no matter what the cost.”  I have no idea which was actually asked to the survey participants, but it’s a reminder of the difficulties of public opinion research—sometimes you don’t even know what question was asked!
 
I’m not implying anything sinister on Schoen’s part, it’s just interesting to see these two documents floating around.
 
P.S.

<p>Introduction: StackOverflow  has been a  popular community where software developers would help one another. Recently they  raised some VC funding , and to make profits they are selling job postings and expanding the model to other areas.  Metaoptimize LLC  has started a similar website, using the open-source  OSQA framework  for such as statistics and machine learning. Here’s a description:
  

You and other data geeks can ask and answer questions on machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, text analysis, information retrieval, search, data mining, statistical modeling, and data visualization.
   

Here you can ask and answer questions, comment and vote for the questions of others and their answers. Both questions and answers can be revised and improved. Questions can be tagged with the relevant keywords to simplify future access and organize the accumulated material.

  
If you work very hard on your questions and answers, you will receive badges like “Guru”, “Studen</p><p>same-blog 4 0.87130183 <a title="1058-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-14-Higgs_bozos%3A__Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_are_spinning_in_their_graves.html">1058 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-14-Higgs bozos:  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are spinning in their graves</a></p>
<p>Introduction: David Hogg sends in this  bizarre bit  of news reporting by Robert Evans:
  
Until now, in the four decades since it was first posited, no one has convincingly claimed to have glimpsed the Higgs Boson, let alone proved that it actually exists.


At an eagerly awaited briefing on Tuesday at the CERN research centre near Geneva, two independent teams of “Higgs Hunters” – a term they themselves hate – were widely expected to suggest they were fairly confident they had spotted it.


But not confident enough, in the physics world of ultra-precision where certainty has to be measured at nothing less than 100 percent, to announce “a discovery.”


In the jargon, this level is described as 5 sigma . . .
  
So far, so good.  But then comes this doozy:
  
As one scientist explained, that level of accuracy would equate to the 17th-century discoverer of gravity, Isaac Newton, sitting under his apple tree and a million apples one after another falling on his head without one missing.
  
Huh?  A free</p><p>5 0.87051177 <a title="1058-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-21-New_search_engine_for_data_%26_statistics.html">724 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-21-New search engine for data & statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jon Goldhill points us to a new search engine,  Zanran , which is for finding data and statistics.  Goldhill writes:
  
It’s useful when you’re looking for a graph/table rather than a single number.  For example, if you look for ‘teenage births rates in the united states’ in Zanran you’ll see a series of graphs.  If you check in Google, there’s plenty of material – but you’d have to open everything up to see if it had any real numbers.  (I hope you’ll appreciate Zanran’s preview capability as well – hovering over the icons gives a useful preview of the content.)</p><p>6 0.87004972 <a title="1058-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-28-What_Zombies_see_in_Scatterplots.html">595 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-28-What Zombies see in Scatterplots</a></p>

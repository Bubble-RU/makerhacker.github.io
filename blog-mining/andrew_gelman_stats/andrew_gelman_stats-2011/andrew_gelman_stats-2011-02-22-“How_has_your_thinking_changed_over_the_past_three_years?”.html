<p>Introduction: My article with Daniel and Yair  has recently appeared in The Forum:
  
We use multilevel modeling to estimate support for health-care reform by age, income, and state. Opposition to reform is concentrated among higher-income voters and those over 65. Attitudes do not vary much by state. Unfortunately, our poll data only go to 2004, but we suspect that much can be learned from the relative positions of different demographic groups and different states, despite swings in national opinion. We speculate on the political implications of these findings.
  
The article features some pretty graphs that originally appeared on the blog.
 
It’s in a special issue on health care politics that has several interesting articles, among which I’d like to single out  this one  by Bob Shapiro and Lawrence Jacobs entitled, “Simulating Representation: Elite Mobilization and Political Power in Health Care Reform”:

<p>Introduction: I saw this picture staring at me from the newsstand the other day:
 
 
 
 Here’s  the accompanying article, by Michael Scherer and Michael Duffy, which echoes some of the points I made  a few months ago , following the midterm election:
  
Why didn’t Obama do a better job of leveling with the American people? In his first months in office, why didn’t he anticipate the example of the incoming British government and warn people of economic blood, sweat, and tears? Why did his economic team release overly-optimistic graphs such as shown here? Wouldn’t it have been better to have set low expectations and then exceed them, rather than the reverse?


I don’t know, but here’s my theory. When Obama came into office, I imagine one of his major goals was to avoid repeating the experiences of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter in their first two years.


Clinton, you may recall, was elected with less then 50% of the vote, was never given the respect of a “mandate” by congressional Republicans, wasted</p><p>4 0.12886886 <a title="585-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-13-%243M_health_care_prediction_challenge.html">465 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-13-$3M health care prediction challenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: i received the following press release from the Heritage Provider Network, “the largest limited Knox-Keene licensed managed care organization in California.”  I have no idea what this means, but I assume it’s some sort of HMO.
 
In any case,  this looks like  it could be interesting:
  
Participants in the Health Prize challenge will be given a data set comprised of the de-identified medical records of 100,000 individuals who are members of HPN.  The teams will then need to predict the hospitalization of a set percentage of those members who went to the hospital during the year following the start date, and do so with a defined accuracy rate.  The winners will receive the $3 million prize. . . . the contest is designed to spur involvement by others involved in analytics, such as those involved in data mining and predictive modeling who may not currently be working in health care.  “We believe that doing so will bring innovative thinking to health analytics and may allow us to solve at</p><p>5 0.12561768 <a title="585-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-19-How_Americans_vote.html">2255 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-19-How Americans vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>6 0.11960371 <a title="585-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-15-Mr._P_by_another_name_._._._is_still_great%21.html">769 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-15-Mr. P by another name . . . is still great!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Even if a policymaker is sure of the ideal economic policy, he or she can only implement it with the help of some of the other political players.
 
But I’m saying something different, echoing what I  wrote  a couple days ago.  I thought of this the other day after seeing this recent quote from Paul Krugman ( extracted  by Brad DeLong) about Larry  “Starbucks”  Summers:
  
Summers is . . . indistinguishable from me [Krugman] on macro-policy. And he may be a bit to the left, because he’s even more certain than I am . . . that some extra spending now will actually help us more in fiscal terms. So he published a piece in the Financial Times that was meant to be a big statement about this. But before he got to that, he spend three paragraphs about the importance of dealing with the deficit in the medium term . . . to establish that ‘I am a respectable person; I am not like that rabble-rouser, Krugman.’ . . .
  
Maybe.  But, going back to 2009, I still suspect that Summers, or some part of S</p><p>4 0.72800475 <a title="585-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-20-No_no_no_no_no.html">1020 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-20-No no no no no</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I enjoy the London Review of Books but I’m not a fan of their policy of hiring English people to write about U.S. politics.  In theory it could work just fine but in practice there seem to be problems.  Recall  the notorious line  from a couple years ago, “But viewed in retrospect, it is clear that it has been quite predictable.”
 
More recently I noticed  this , from John Lanchester:
  
Republicans, egged on by their newly empowered Tea Party wing, didn’t take the deal, and forced the debate on raising the debt ceiling right to the edge of an unprecedented and globally catastrophic US default. The process ended with surrender on the part of President Obama and the Democrats. There is near unanimity among economists that the proposals in the agreed package will at best make recovery from the recession more difficult, and at worst may trigger a second, even more severe downturn.  The disturbing thing about the whole process wasn’t so much that the Tea Partiers were irrational as that th</p><p>5 0.7035526 <a title="585-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-28-Advocacy_in_the_form_of_a_%E2%80%9Cdeliberative_forum%E2%80%9D.html">113 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-28-Advocacy in the form of a “deliberative forum”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Sides   reports on  a paper by Benjamin Page and Lawrence Jacobs about so-called deliberative forums, in particular a set of meetings called America Speaks that have been organized and conducted by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an  organization  formed by the former advertising executive, Secretary of Commerce, and investment banker to focus attention on the national debt.
 
Sides, Page, and Jacobs discuss three key points:
  

 
1. Any poll or focus group is only as good as its sample, and there is no evidence that the participants in the America Speaks forums were selected in a way to be representative of the nation.  Page and Jacobs write:
  
Deliberative forums often fail to get a representative sample of Americans to participate, even when they try hard to do so.

Over the past three years, we have experienced an amazing number of political, economic, and legislative trials. I suppose it’s human nature to respond to such events by doubling down on our own prior strongly-held beliefs. Health care reform/TARP/stimulus, whatever–that proves that I am even more right than I thought I was!


That’s really too bad. We’ve been through some hard trials recently, in multiple senses. We’ve been tested by difficult times. We’ve also had the opportunity to see many of our beliefs tested through real-world experiments that should challenge our ideological, strategic, and policy views. Anyone active and attentive should be thinking differently about _something_ important after having witnessed so much history being made so quickly on so many different fronts.


Have your own views changed on any basic issues of domestic policy? I’m not so much interested in your assessment of particular politicians or specific political tactics.

<p>Introduction: Richard Van Noorden reports  in  Nature  that 95% of the authors submitting to the Nature Publishing Group choose more restrictive open-source licenses, CC-BY-NC-SA or CC-BY-NC-ND, even when given the opportunity to use a much more open license, CC-BY.  (I include their data below.)
 
How open should papers be?  Should authors own their work or should universities?  What if they’re paid for by a government research grant?  For instance, should NIH go further in requiring openness than it already has?  
 
Personally, I don’t mind publishers trying to make a buck off my papers.  But I don’t want to write something and then hand them the copyright, because then they’ll try to restrict the distribution.

<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  a paper  by Chandler McClellan and Erdal Tekin which begins as follows:
  
The controversies surrounding Stand Your Ground laws have recently captured the nation’s attention. Since 2005, eighteen states have passed laws extending the right to self-defense with no duty to retreat to any place a person has a legal right to be, and several additional states are debating the adoption of similar legislation. Despite the implications that these laws may have for public safety, there has been little empirical investigation of their impact on crime and victimization. In this paper, we use monthly data from the U.S. Vital Statistics to examine how Stand Your Ground laws affect homicides. We identify the impact of these laws by exploiting variation in the effective date of these laws across states. Our results indicate that Stand Your Ground laws are associated with a significant increase in the number of homicides among whites, especially white males.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to an  article  by Riccardo Puglisi, who writes:
  

Controlling for the activity of the incumbent president and the U.S. Congress across issues, I find that during a presidential campaign, The New York Times gives more emphasis to topics on which the Democratic party is perceived as more competent (civil rights, health care, labor and social welfare) when the incumbent president is a Republican. This is consistent with the hypothesis that The New York Times has a Democratic partisanship, with some “anti-incumbent” aspects . . . consistent with The New York Times departing from demand-driven news coverage.

  
I haven’t read the article in the question but the claim seems plausible to me.  I’ve often thought there is an asymmetry in media bias, with Democratic reporters–a survey a few years ago found that twice as many journalists identify as Democrats than as Republicans–biasing their reporting by choosing which topics to focus on, and Republican news organization</p><p>5 0.95111763 <a title="585-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-There_are_four_ways_to_get_fired_from_Caesars%3A__%281%29_theft%2C_%282%29_sexual_harassment%2C_%283%29_running_an_experiment_without_a_control_group%2C_and_%284%29_keeping_a_gambling_addict_away_from_the_casino.html">1619 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-There are four ways to get fired from Caesars:  (1) theft, (2) sexual harassment, (3) running an experiment without a control group, and (4) keeping a gambling addict away from the casino</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ever since I got this new sound system for my bike, I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts.  This American Life is really good.  I know, I know, everybody knows that, but it’s true.  The only segments I don’t like are the ones that are too “writerly,” when they read a short story aloud.  They don’t work for me.  Most of the time, though, the show is as great as everyone says it is.
 
Anyway, the other day I listened to  program #466:  Blackjack .  It started with some items on card counting.  That stuff is always fun.  Then they get to the longer story, which is all about a moderately rich housewife from Iowa who, over a roughly ten-year period, lost her life savings, something like a million dollars, at Harrah’s casinos.  Did you know they had casinos in Iowa and Indiana?  I didn’t.  Anyway, the lady was a gambling addict.  That part’s pretty clear.  You don’t lose your life savings at a casino by accident.
 
The scary part, though, was how the casino company craftily enabled her to</p><p>6 0.94681263 <a title="585-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-25-Subsidized_driving.html">1693 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-25-Subsidized driving</a></p>

<p>Introduction: That’s Tyler Cowen’s  policy . I read almost all the comments here.  I’m glad I read them, I think.  Over the years, I’ve learned a lot of interesting things from the comments.  Sometimes, though, I wish I hadn’t bothered.  Cowen gets about 10 times as many comments as I do, so I think in his case it makes sense to just ignore them.  If he read (or, even worse, responded to) them, he’d have no time for anything else.</p><p>4 0.13443321 <a title="528-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-26-NYC.html">926 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-26-NYC</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our downstairs neighbor hates us.  She looks away from us when we see them on the street, if we’re coming into the building at the same time she doesn’t hold open the door, and if we’re in the elevator when it stops on her floor, she refuses to get on.
 
On the other hand, if you’re a sociology professor in Chicago, one of your colleagues might try to run you over in a parking lot.  So I guess I’m getting off easy.</p><p>5 0.11850174 <a title="528-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-04-Why_does_anyone_support_private_macroeconomic_forecasts%3F.html">185 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-04-Why does anyone support private macroeconomic forecasts?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The usually-reasonable-even-if-you-disagree-with-him Tyler Cowen  writes :
  
Presumably diplomats either enjoy serving their country or they enjoy the ego rents of being a diplomat or both.  It is a false feeling of power, borrowed power from one’s country of origin rather than from one’s personal achievements.
  
Huh?  I’d hardly think this needs to be explained, but here goes:
  

 
1.  Diplomats may feel the  duty  to serve their country, which is not the same as “enjoying” it.  Sometimes people take on jobs that are challenging and not well-paid because they feel that it is their duty to do their best at it.
 
2.  Some diplomats are very accomplished individuals, and that is why they are chosen to represent their country.  Consider an analogy:  Yes, Tyler Cowen borrows some power from George Mason University.  But it goes the other way too:  GMU borrows power from TC.
 
Beyond all this, and returning to more selfish goals, being a diplomat can be fun–you get to live in a foreign c</p><p>3 0.64882362 <a title="528-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-28-Writing_for_free.html">2080 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-28-Writing for free</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Max Read  points  to discussions by  Cord Jefferson  and  Tim Krieger  about people who write for free, thus depressing the wages of paid journalists.
 
The topic interests me because I’m one of those people who writes for free, all the time.
 
As a commenter  wrote  in response to Cord Jefferson’s article:
  
It’s not just people who have inherited money, it’s also people who have “day jobs” to support themselves while they pursue dream jobs in fields like journalism, fiction writing, theater and music.
  
In this case, I’m pursuing the dream job of blogging, but it’s the same basic idea.
 
I actually enjoy doing this, which is more than can be said of Tim Kreider, who writes:
  
I will freely admit that writing beats baling hay or going door-to-door for a living, but it’s still shockingly unenjoyable work.
  
I’m lucky enough not to ever have had to bale hay or go door-to-door for a living, but I find writing to be enjoyable!  So I can see how it can be hard for Kreider to compete wi</p><p>4 0.6473971 <a title="528-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-Sloppily-written_slam_on_moderately_celebrated_writers_is_amusing_nonetheless.html">204 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-Sloppily-written slam on moderately celebrated writers is amusing nonetheless</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Via  J. Robert Lennon , I discovered  this amusing blog  by Anis Shivani on “The 15 Most Overrated Contemporary American Writers.”
 
Lennon found it so annoying that he refused to even link to it, but I actually enjoyed Shivani’s bit of performance art.  The literary criticism I see is so focused on individual books that it’s refreshing to see someone take on an entire author’s career in a single paragraph.  I agree with Lennon that Shivani’s blog doesn’t have much  content –it’s full of terms such as “vacuity” and “pap,” compared to which “trendy” and “fashionable” are precision instruments–but Shivani covers a lot of ground and it’s fun to see this all in one place.
 
My main complaint with Shivani, beyond his sloppy writing (but, hey, it’s just a blog; I’m sure he saves the good stuff for his paid gigs) is his implicit assumption that everyone should agree with him.  I’m as big a Kazin fan as anyone, but I still think he completely undervalued  Marquand .

I have mixed feelings about the move of the Monkey Cage blog to the Washington Post.  I’ve been told we get many more readers, but the the comments have declined in number and in quality.  It used to be that posting at the Monkey Cage felt like “blogging”:  I’d post something there and look at the comments.  It was a political science community with many participants from outside the field.  Posting at the new blog is more like writing for the newspaper:  it’s a broadcast without real feedback.  This all makes me realize how much I appreciate the commenters here.

<p>Introduction: Cathy O’Neil  organized  this visualization project  with NYPD stop-and-frisk data.  It’s part of the Data Without Borders project.  Unfortunately, because of legal restrictions I couldn’t send them the data Jeff, Alex, and I used in  our project  several years ago.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9804101 <a title="528-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-21-Elevator_shame_is_a_two-way_street.html">528 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-21-Elevator shame is a two-way street</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  a  blog  by Samuel Arbesman mocking people who are so lazy that they take the elevator from 1 to 2.

<p>Introduction: Malecki asks:
  
Is  this  the worst infographic ever to appear in NYT?  USA Today is not something to aspire to.
  
To connect to some of our recent  themes , I agree this is a pretty horrible data display.  But it’s not bad as a series of images.  Considering the competition to be a cartoon or series of photos, these images aren’t so bad.
 
One issue, I think, is that designers get credit for creativity and originality (unusual color combinations!  Histogram bars shaped like mosques!) , which is often the opposite of what we want in a clear graph.  It’s Martin Amis vs. George Orwell all over again.</p><p>5 0.97022253 <a title="528-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-12-Where_are_the_larger-than-life_athletes%3F.html">1115 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-12-Where are the larger-than-life athletes?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  points  to this  poll  estimating rifle-armed QB Tim Tebow as America’s favorite pro athlete:
  
In an ESPN survey of 1,502 Americans age 12 or older, three percent identified Tebow as their favorite professional athlete.  Tebow finished in front of Kobe Bryant (2 percent), Aaron Rodgers (1.9 percent), Peyton Manning (1.8 percent), and Tom Brady (1.5 percent).
  
Amusing.  What this survey says to me is that there are no super-popular athletes who are active in America today.  Which actually sounds about right.  No Tiger Woods, no Magic Johnson, Muhammed Ali, John Elway, Pete Rose, Billie Jean King, etc etc.  Tebow is an amusing choice, people might as well pick him now while he’s still on top.  As a sports celeb, he’s like Bill Lee or the Refrigerator:  colorful and a solid pro athlete, but no superstar.
 
When you think about all the colorful superstar athletes of times gone by, it’s perhaps surprising that there’s nobody out there right now to play the role.

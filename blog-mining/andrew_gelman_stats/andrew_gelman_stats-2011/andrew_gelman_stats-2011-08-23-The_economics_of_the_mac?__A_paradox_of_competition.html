I’m working to get up and running with the examples from the book, but I’m running into several problems, all apparently stemming from my having a Mac as opposed to a PC. Specifically I cannot load the “arm” library because I cannot install the lme4 library as lme4 is not available for Macs. 
 

 
Yu-Sung replied:
  
Here are steps for you to install lme4:


1. update your x11 code for Mac system (so that you have gcc and g77 complier)


2. download source code for lme4 from the CRAN.


3. install lme4 from the source you just downloaded.


I am not a Mac user.  I am adapting steps from installing lme4 in a linux OS.

<p>Introduction: Aleks pointed me to  this recent article  by Pablo Mateos, Paul Longley, and David O’Sullivan on one of my favorite topics.
 
The authors produced a potentially cool  naming network of the city of Auckland New Zealand .  I say “potentially cool” because I have such difficulty reading the article–I speak English, statistics, and a bit of political science and economics, but this one is written in heavy sociologese–that I can’t quite be sure what they’re doing.  However, despite my (perhaps unfair) disdain for the particulars of their method, it’s probably good that they’re jumping in with this analysis.  Others can take their data (and similar datasets from elsewhere) and do better.  Ya gotta start somewhere, and the basic idea (to cluster first names that are associated with the same last names, and to cluster last names that are associated with the same first names) seems good.
 
I have to admit, though, that I was amused by the following line, which, amazingly, led off the paper:</p><p>6 0.63946086 <a title="867-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-10-A_quick_suggestion.html">1207 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-10-A quick suggestion</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I switched to the mac and it’s great  I’d like a bit more real estate on my laptop but Malecki assures me that soon I’ll get used to jumping between windows.
 
Anyway, my impression is that now the mac dominates the pc, but a few years ago it wasn’t so clear.  The mac had some nice features but often ran slowly, and thinkpads could do a lot.  At the time, the way I understood this was that only one company made macs but several made pc’s, thus there was a lot of competition, stimulating innovation in the pc market.
 
But what’s the story now?  The macbook air is awesome and a real advance on what came before, while the thinkpads and all the rest have stagnated.  So what’s my new theory?  There’s lots of competition on pc’s, but what they’re all competing on is price.  Meanwhile, only one company makes the mac and so they have the freedom to make something good.
 
But I’m just blathering here.  I’m sure someone can offer some thick description to reveal the real story.</p><p>2 0.91029954 <a title="867-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-30-Statisticians%3A_When_We_Teach%2C_We_Don%E2%80%99t_Practice_What_We_Preach.html">1237 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-30-Statisticians: When We Teach, We Don’t Practice What We Preach</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jason Roos sends along  this article :
  
On election days many of us see a colorful map of the U.S. where each tiny county has a color on the continuum between red and blue. So far we have not used such data to improve the effectiveness of marketing models. In this study, we show that we should.


We demonstrate the usefulness of political data via an interesting application–the demand for movies. Using boxoffice data from 25 counties in the U.S. Midwest (21 quarters between 2000 and 2005) we show that by including political data one can improve out-of-sample predictions significantly. Specifically, we estimate the improvement in forecasts due to the addition of political data to be around $43 million per year for the entire U.S. theatrical market.


Furthermore, when it comes to movies we depart from previous work in another way. While previous studies have relied on pre-determined movie genres, we estimate perceived movie attributes in a latent space and formulate viewers’ tastes as</p><p>4 0.89265764 <a title="867-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-14-Learning_how_to_speak.html">1938 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-14-Learning how to speak</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been trying to reduce my American accent when speaking French.  I tried taping my voice and playing it back, but that didn’t help.  I couldn’t actually tell that I had a strong accent by listening to myself.  My own voice is just too familiar to me.  Then Malecki told me about the international phonetic alphabet, which is just great.  And there’s even  a convenient website  that translates.  For example,
  
le loup est revenu -> lə lu ε ʀəvny
  
I stared at Malecki’s mouth while he said the phrase, and I finally understood the difference between the two different “oo” sounds.  That evening at home I tried it out on the local expert and he laughed at my attempts but grudgingly admitted I was getting better.  On about the 10th try, after watching him say it over and over and staring at his mouth, I was finally able to do it!
 
I know this is going to sound stupid to all you linguistics experts out there, but I had no idea that you could figure out how to speak better by staring at s</p><p>5 0.89044404 <a title="867-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-16-Detecting_cheating_in_chess.html">1676 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-16-Detecting cheating in chess</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Three different people have pointed me to  this post  by Ken Regan on statistical evaluation of claims of cheating in chess.  So I figured I have to satisfy demand and post something on this.  But I have nothing to say.  All these topics interest me, but I somehow had difficulty reading through the entire post.  I scanned through but what I really wanted to see was some data.  Show me a scatterplot, then I’ll get interested.
 
P.S.  This is meant as no disparagement of Regan or his blog.  I just couldn’t quite get into this particular example.</p><p>6 0.88134402 <a title="867-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-06-More_on_the_differences_between_drugs_and_medical_devices.html">322 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-06-More on the differences between drugs and medical devices</a></p>

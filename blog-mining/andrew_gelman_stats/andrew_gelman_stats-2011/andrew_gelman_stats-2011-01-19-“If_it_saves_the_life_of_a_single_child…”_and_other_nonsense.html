<p>Introduction: Rohin Dhar  writes :
  
While bike theft is an epidemic in major US cities, most people seem resigned that it’s just a fact of life. . . . at Priceonomics, we thought we’d take a crack at trying to reduce bike theft. Could we use software to help people fight back against bike thieves?


Professional bike thieves exist because they can make a profit. Luckily, this author went to business school and remembers exactly one equation from the experience:


Profit = Revenue – Cost


From a criminal’s perspective, the “Cost” of bike theft is about zero. The odds of getting caught are negligible and the penalty is about zero as well. Most commentators suggest that in order to prevent bike theft, the government should increase the penalties to make it a less attractive crime. As we stated earlier, we somehow doubt government intervention is going to happen any time soon.


We decided to focus on the revenue half of the equation. Could we make it harder for bike thieves to turn their contraband</p><p>3 0.15457234 <a title="526-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-11-Yes%2C_the_decision_to_try_%28or_not%29_to_have_a_child_can_be_made_rationally.html">1758 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-11-Yes, the decision to try (or not) to have a child can be made rationally</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Philosopher L. A. Paul and sociologist Kieran Healy  write :
  
Choosing to have a child involves a leap of faith, not a carefully calibrated rational choice. When surprising results surface about the dissatisfaction many parents experience, telling yourself that you knew it wouldn’t be that way for you is simply a rationalization. The same is true if you tell yourself you know you’re happier not being a parent. The standard story of parenthood says it’s a deeply fulfilling event that is like nothing else you’ve ever experienced, and that you should carefully weigh what it will be like before choosing to do it. But in reality you can’t have it both ways.
  
I disagree that you can’t have it both ways, for three reasons:
 
1.  Many potential parents  do  have an idea of what it will be like to be a parent, having participated in child care as an older sibling, aunt, or uncle.
 
2.  The decision of whether to have a child occurs many times:  the decision of whether to have a second child</p><p>4 0.14736736 <a title="526-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-18-The_Fixie_Bike_Index.html">1127 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-18-The Fixie Bike Index</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Where are the fixed-gear bike riders?
 
   
 
Rohin Dhar  explains : 
  
  
At Priceonomics, in order to build our bicycle price guide, we measure what kind of used bikes people are trying to sell and the quantity sold in any city. By mining our database of 1.3 million bicycle listings, we can tell what are the largest markets for used bicycles, how the prices vary by region, and where people who prize fixed gear bikes live.


Fixies (fixed gear bikes) are considered to be a strong indicator of hipsterness. For those unfamiliar, a fixed gear bike requires riding in a single gear and the only way to stop the bike is to pedal backwards to help skid the bike to a halt. You can’t “coast” on a fixie; when you are biking downhill, your pedals will keep moving so you better keep pedaling too. Because of the minimalism of this fixed gear system, the bikes tend to be aesthetically pleasing but somewhat challenging to ride. . . .


   


In short, fixed gear bikes = hipsters, and New York boroug</p><p>5 0.14402235 <a title="526-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-18-Bike_shelf.html">349 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-18-Bike shelf</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Four recent news stories about crime and punishment made me realize, yet again, how little I understand all this.
 
1.   “HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Charges of Money Laundering” :
  
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world’s largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.  Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. . . .
  
I don’t understand this idea of punishing the institution.  I have the same problem when the NCAA punishes a college football program.  These are individual people breaking the law (or the rules), right?  So why not punish them directly?  Giving 40 lashes to a bunch of HSBC executives and garnisheeing their salaries for life, say, that wouldn’t destabilize the global financial system would it?  From the article:  “A money-laundering indictment, or a guilt</p><p>3 0.81471652 <a title="526-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-05-Elites_have_alcohol_problems_too%21.html">1789 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-05-Elites have alcohol problems too!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Speaking of  Tyler Cowen, I’m puzzled by  this paragraph  of his:
  
Guns, like alcohol, have many legitimate uses, and they are enjoyed by many people in a responsible manner.  In both cases, there is an elite which has absolutely no problems handling the institution in question, but still there is the question of whether the nation really can have such bifurcated social norms, namely one set of standards for the elite and another set for everybody else.
  
I don’t know anything about guns so I’ll set that part aside.  My bafflement is with the claim that “there is an elite which has absolutely no problem handling [alcohol].”  Is he kidding?  Unless Cowen is circularly defining “an elite” as the subset of elites who don’t have an alcohol problem, I don’t buy this claim.  And I actually think it’s a serious problem, that various “elites” are so sure that they have “absolutely no problem” that they do dangerous, dangerous things.

<p>Introduction: As part of his continuing plan to sap etc etc., Aleks pointed me to  an article  by Max Miller reporting on a recommendation from Jacob Appel:
  
Adding trace amounts of lithium to the drinking water could limit suicides. . . . Communities with higher than average amounts of lithium in their drinking water had significantly lower suicide rates than communities with lower levels. Regions of Texas with lower lithium concentrations had an average suicide rate of 14.2 per 100,000 people, whereas those areas with naturally higher lithium levels had a dramatically lower suicide rate of 8.7 per 100,000.  The highest levels in Texas (150 micrograms of lithium per liter of water) are only a thousandth of the minimum pharmaceutical dose, and have no known deleterious effects.
  
I don’t know anything about this and am offering no judgment on it; I’m just passing it on.  The research studies are  here  and  here .  I am skeptical, though, about this part of the argument:

<p>Introduction: This article  by Thomas Crag, at Copenhagenize, is marred by reliance on old data, but it’s so full of informative graphical displays — most of them not made by the author, I think — that it’s hard to pick just one.  But here ya go. This figure shows fatalities (among cyclists) versus distance cycled, with a point for each year…unfortunately ending in way back in 1998, but still: 
   This is a good alternative to the more common choice for this sort of plot, which would be overlaying curves of fatalities vs time and distance cycled vs time.  
 
The article also explicitly discusses the fact,  previously discussed on this blog , that it’s misleading, to the point of being wrong in most contexts, to compare the safety of walking vs cycling vs driving by looking at the casualty or fatality rate  per kilometer .  Often, as in this article, the question of interest is something like, if more people switched from driving to cycling, how many more or fewer people would die?

<p>Introduction: William Perkins, Mark Tygert, and Rachel Ward  write :
  
If a discrete probability distribution in a model being tested for goodness-of-fit is not close to uniform, then forming the Pearson χ2 statistic can involve division by nearly zero. This often leads to serious trouble in practice — even in the absence of round-off errors . . .
  
The problem is not merely that the chi-squared  statistic  doesn’t have the advertised chi-squared  distribution —a reference distribution can always be computed via simulation, either using the posterior predictive distribution or by conditioning on a point estimate of the cell expectations and then making a degrees-of-freedom sort of adjustment.
 
Rather, the problem is that, when there are lots of cells with near-zero expectation, the chi-squared test is mostly noise.
 
And this is not merely a theoretical problem.  It comes up in real examples.

<p>Introduction: Earlier today, Nate  criticized  a U.S. military survey that asks troops the question, “Do you currently serve with a male or female Service member you  believe  to be homosexual.” [emphasis added]  As Nate points out, by asking this question in such a speculative way, “it would seem that you’ll be picking up a tremendous number of false positives–soldiers who are believed to be gay, but aren’t–and that these false positives will swamp any instances in which soldiers (in spite of DADT) are actually somewhat open about their same-sex attractions.”
 
This is a general problem in survey research. In an  article  in Chance magazine in 1997, “The myth of millions of annual self-defense gun uses:  a case study of survey overestimates of rare events” [see  here  for related references], David Hemenway uses the false-positive, false-negative reasoning to explain this bias in terms of probability theory.

Purdue University School of ECE Faculty Position in Human-Centered Computing


The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University invites applications for a faculty position at any level in human-centered computing, including but not limited to visualization, visual analytics, human-computer interaction (HCI), imaging, and graphics. . . .  Applications  should consist of a cover letter, a CV, research and teaching statements, names and contact information for at least three references, and URLs for three to five online papers. . . . We will consider applications through March 2013.
  
It’s great to see this sort of thing.
 
P.S.  Amusingly enough, the Purdue Visualization and Analytics Center has an ugly, bureaucratic, text-heavy  webpage .  Not that I’m one to talk, the Columbia stat dept has an ugly webpage too (although I think we’ll be switching soon to something better).</p><p>5 0.94448161 <a title="526-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-03-is_it_possible_to_%E2%80%9Coverstratify%E2%80%9D_when_assigning_a_treatment_in_a_randomized_control_trial%3F.html">553 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-03-is it possible to “overstratify” when assigning a treatment in a randomized control trial?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Peter Bergman writes:
  
is it possible to “overstratify” when assigning a treatment in a randomized control trial?  I [Bergman] have a sample size of roughly 400 people, and several binary variables correlate strongly with the outcome of interest and would also define interesting subgroups for analysis.  The problem is, stratifying over all of these (five or six) variables leaves me with strata that have only 1 person in them.  I have done some background reading on whether there is a rule of thumb for the maximum number of variables to stratify.  There does not seem to be much agreement (some say there should be between N/50-N/100 strata, others say as few as possible).  In economics, the paper I looked to is here, which seems to summarize literature related to clinical trials.  In short, my question is: is it bad to have several strata with 1 person in them? Should I group these people in with another stratum?

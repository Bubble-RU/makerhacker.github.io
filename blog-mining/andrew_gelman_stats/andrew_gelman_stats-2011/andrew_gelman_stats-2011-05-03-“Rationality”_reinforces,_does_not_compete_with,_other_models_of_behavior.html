<p>Introduction: Nowadays “Bayesian” is often taken to be a synonym for rationality, and I can see how this can irritate thoughtful philosophers and statisticians alike: To start with, lots of rational thinking—even lots of rational statistical inference—does not occur within the Bayesian formalism. And, to look at it from the other direction, lots of self-proclaimed Bayesian inference hardly seems rational at all.  And in what way is “subjective probability” a model for rational scientific inquiry? On the contrary, subjectivity and rationality are in many ways opposites!  [emphasis added]


The goal of this paper is to break the link between Bayesian modeling (good, in my opinion) and subjectivity (bad). From this perspective, the irritation of falsificationists regarding exaggerated claims of Bayesian rationality are my ally. . . .

<p>Introduction: I think I can best do my civic duty by running this one every Election Day, just like Art Buchwald on Thanksgiving. . . .
  
With a national election coming up, and with the publicity at its maximum, now is a good time to ask, is it rational for you to vote? And, by extension, wass it worth your while to pay attention to whatever the candidates and party leaders have been saying for the  year or so? With a chance of casting a decisive vote that is comparable to the chance of winning the lottery, what is the gain from being a good citizen and casting your vote?


The short answer is, quite a lot. First the bad news. With 100 million voters, your chance that your vote will be decisive–even if the national election is predicted to be reasonably close–is, at best, 1 in a million in a battleground district and much less in a noncompetitive district such as where I live.

Choosing to have a child involves a leap of faith, not a carefully calibrated rational choice.

I disagree that you can’t have it both ways, for three reasons:
 
1.  Many potential parents  do  have an idea of what it will be like to be a parent, having participated in child care as an older sibling, aunt, or uncle.

<p>Introduction: John Sides  followed up  on a discussion of his  earlier claim  that political independents vote for president in a reasonable way based on economic performance.  John’s original post led to the amazing claim by New Republic writer Jonathan Chait that John wouldn’t “even want to be friends with anybody who” voted in this manner.
 
I’ve been sensitive to discussions of rationality and voting ever since Aaron Edlin, Noah Kaplan, and I wrote  our article  on voting as a rational choice:  why and how people vote to improve the well-being of others.
 
Models of rationality are controversial In politics, just as they are in other fields ranging from economics to criminology.  On one side you have people trying to argue that all behavior is rational, from lottery playing to drug addiction to engaging in email with exiled Nigerian royalty.  Probably the only behavior that nobody has yet to claim is rational is blogging, but I bet that’s coming too.  From the other direction, lots of people poi</p><p>2 0.9724133 <a title="692-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-There_are_four_ways_to_get_fired_from_Caesars%3A__%281%29_theft%2C_%282%29_sexual_harassment%2C_%283%29_running_an_experiment_without_a_control_group%2C_and_%284%29_keeping_a_gambling_addict_away_from_the_casino.html">1619 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-There are four ways to get fired from Caesars:  (1) theft, (2) sexual harassment, (3) running an experiment without a control group, and (4) keeping a gambling addict away from the casino</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ever since I got this new sound system for my bike, I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts.  This American Life is really good.  I know, I know, everybody knows that, but it’s true.  The only segments I don’t like are the ones that are too “writerly,” when they read a short story aloud.  They don’t work for me.  Most of the time, though, the show is as great as everyone says it is.
 
Anyway, the other day I listened to  program #466:  Blackjack .  It started with some items on card counting.  That stuff is always fun.  Then they get to the longer story, which is all about a moderately rich housewife from Iowa who, over a roughly ten-year period, lost her life savings, something like a million dollars, at Harrah’s casinos.  Did you know they had casinos in Iowa and Indiana?  I didn’t.  Anyway, the lady was a gambling addict.  That part’s pretty clear.  You don’t lose your life savings at a casino by accident.
 
The scary part, though, was how the casino company craftily enabled her to</p><p>3 0.97033733 <a title="692-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-22-Is_it_meaningful_to_talk_about_a_probability_of_%E2%80%9C65.7%25%E2%80%9D_that_Obama_will_win_the_election%3F.html">1544 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-22-Is it meaningful to talk about a probability of “65.7%” that Obama will win the election?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day we had a fun little discussion in  the comments section of the sister blog  about the appropriateness of stating forecast probabilities to the nearest tenth of a percentage point.
 
It started when Josh Tucker posted this graph from  Nate Silver :
 
   
 
My first reaction was:  this looks pretty but it’s hyper-precise.  I’m a big fan of Nate’s work, but all those little wiggles on the graph can’t really mean anything.  And what could it possibly mean to compute this probability to that level of precision?
 
In the comments, people came at me from two directions.  From one side, Jeffrey Friedman  expressed  a hard core attitude that it’s meaningless to give a probability forecast of a unique event:
  
What could it possibly mean, period, given that this election will never be repeated? . . . I know there’s a vast literature on this, but I’m still curious, as a non-statistician, what it could mean for there to be a meaningful 65% probability (as opposed to a non-quantifiab</p><p>4 0.97007382 <a title="692-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-05-Let%E2%80%99s_try_this%3A__Instead_of_saying%2C_%E2%80%9CThe_probability_is_75%25%2C%E2%80%9D_say_%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s_a_25%25_chance_I%E2%80%99m_wrong%E2%80%9D.html">1562 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-05-Let’s try this:  Instead of saying, “The probability is 75%,” say “There’s a 25% chance I’m wrong”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently  wrote  about the difficulty people have with probabilities, in this case the probability that Obama wins the election. If the probability is reported as 70%, people think Obama is going to win.  Actually, though, it just means that Obama is predicted to get about 50.8% of the two-party vote, with an uncertainty of something like 2 percentage points.  So, as I wrote, the election really is too close to call in the sense that the predicted vote margin is less than its uncertainty.
 
But . . . when people see a number such as 70%, they tend to attribute too much certainty to it.  Especially when the estimated probability has increased from, say 60%.  How to get the point across?  Commenter HS  had  what seems like a good suggestion:
  
Say that Obama will win, but there is 25% chance (or whatever) that this prediction is wrong? Same point, just slightly different framing, but somehow, this seems far less incendiary.
  
I like that.  Somehow a stated probability of 75% sounds a</p><p>5 0.96708769 <a title="692-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-15-Electability_and_perception_of_electability.html">279 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-15-Electability and perception of electability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko writes:
  
We’ve heard a lot recently about the Republican voters going with less electable candidates (last night in particular), but I [Palko] wonder whether this is less a question of putting less weight on electability and more of having a different perception of electability. Is this really a case of primary voters who supported O’Donnell saying “I’d rather be right than be president” or do a large percentage of them believe she has a better than even chance in November.
  
My reply:
 
It’s not so horrible for people to engage in non-strategic voting!  Beyond the immediate probabilities of this candidate winning the Senate election in November, primary challenges keep incumbents accountable.  The thing I don’t really understand is why there aren’t more such challenges.  I suppose they’re unlikely enough to succeed that it’s not usually worth doing it and risking your political career.
 
But, yes, I’m pretty sure that O’Donnell’s voters overestimated the chance that she’</p><p>6 0.96608603 <a title="692-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-09-There%E2%80%99s_no_evidence_that_voters_choose_presidential_candidates_based_on_their_looks.html">654 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-09-There’s no evidence that voters choose presidential candidates based on their looks</a></p>

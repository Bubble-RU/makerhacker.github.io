Pop economists (or, at least, pop micro-economists) are often making one of two arguments:

2.  People are irrational and they need economists, with their open minds, to show them how to be rational and efficient.
 
Argument 1 is associated with “why do they do that?” sorts of puzzles.  Why do they charge so much for candy at the movie theater, why are airline ticket prices such a mess, why are people drug addicts, etc.  The usual answer is that there’s some rational reason for what seems like silly or self-destructive behavior.

<p>Introduction: Nowadays “Bayesian” is often taken to be a synonym for rationality, and I can see how this can irritate thoughtful philosophers and statisticians alike: To start with, lots of rational thinking—even lots of rational statistical inference—does not occur within the Bayesian formalism. And, to look at it from the other direction, lots of self-proclaimed Bayesian inference hardly seems rational at all.  And in what way is “subjective probability” a model for rational scientific inquiry? On the contrary, subjectivity and rationality are in many ways opposites!  [emphasis added]


The goal of this paper is to break the link between Bayesian modeling (good, in my opinion) and subjectivity (bad). From this perspective, the irritation of falsificationists regarding exaggerated claims of Bayesian rationality are my ally. . . .

<p>Introduction: John Sides  followed up  on a discussion of his  earlier claim  that political independents vote for president in a reasonable way based on economic performance.  John’s original post led to the amazing claim by New Republic writer Jonathan Chait that John wouldn’t “even want to be friends with anybody who” voted in this manner.
 
I’ve been sensitive to discussions of rationality and voting ever since Aaron Edlin, Noah Kaplan, and I wrote  our article  on voting as a rational choice:  why and how people vote to improve the well-being of others.
 
Models of rationality are controversial In politics, just as they are in other fields ranging from economics to criminology.  On one side you have people trying to argue that all behavior is rational, from lottery playing to drug addiction to engaging in email with exiled Nigerian royalty.  Probably the only behavior that nobody has yet to claim is rational is blogging, but I bet that’s coming too.  From the other direction, lots of people poi</p><p>5 0.24144082 <a title="809-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-Did_Steven_Levitt_really_believe_in_2008_that_Obama_%E2%80%9Cwould_be_the_greatest_president_in_history%E2%80%9D%3F.html">1650 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-Did Steven Levitt really believe in 2008 that Obama “would be the greatest president in history”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the interview we  discussed  a couple months ago, Steven Levitt said:
  
I [Levitt] voted for Obama [in 2008] because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history.
  
This surprised me.  I’d assumed Levitt was a McCain supporter!  Why?  Because in October, 2008, he wrote that he “loved” the claim by conservative University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”  I’d read that at the time, perhaps incorrectly, as Mulligan making an election-season pitch that the economy was doing just fine (Mulligan:  “if you are not employed by the financial industry (94 percent of you are not), don’t worry”) hence implicitly an argument for a Republican vote in that year (given the usual rules of retrospective voting that the incumbent party gets punished by a poor economy).  And I correspondingly (and, it seems, incorrectly) read Levitt’s endorsement of Mu</p><p>6 0.23976023 <a title="809-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-05-Freakonomics%3A__Why_ask_%E2%80%9CWhat_went_wrong%3F%E2%80%9D.html">1100 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-05-Freakonomics:  Why ask “What went wrong?”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jeff points me to  this  and  this .  There seems to be a perception that “economists, the people who will cooly explain why people will be completely corrupt if the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost, see themselves as being completely not corrupt” (according to Atrios) and that “the economists who have decided to lend their names to the [Romney] campaign have been caught up in this culture of fraud” (according to Krugman).
 
The bloggers above are talking about macro, and perhaps they’re right that macroeconomists see themselves as uncorruptible and above it all.  As with political science, the key parts of macroeconomics are about what is good for the world (or, at least, what is good for the country), and it’s hard to do this well from a level of complete cynicism.

<p>Introduction: Philosopher L. A. Paul and sociologist Kieran Healy  write :
  
Choosing to have a child involves a leap of faith, not a carefully calibrated rational choice. When surprising results surface about the dissatisfaction many parents experience, telling yourself that you knew it wouldn’t be that way for you is simply a rationalization. The same is true if you tell yourself you know you’re happier not being a parent. The standard story of parenthood says it’s a deeply fulfilling event that is like nothing else you’ve ever experienced, and that you should carefully weigh what it will be like before choosing to do it. But in reality you can’t have it both ways.
  
I disagree that you can’t have it both ways, for three reasons:
 
1.  Many potential parents  do  have an idea of what it will be like to be a parent, having participated in child care as an older sibling, aunt, or uncle.
 
2.  The decision of whether to have a child occurs many times:  the decision of whether to have a second child</p><p>5 0.72015727 <a title="809-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-29-When_is_expertise_relevant%3F.html">170 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-29-When is expertise relevant?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Responding to journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s negative review of Freakonomics 2 in the New Yorker, Stephen Dubner  writes , that, although they do not have any training in climate science, it’s also the case that:
  
Neither of us [Levitt and Dubner] were Ku Klux Klan members either, or sumo wrestlers or Realtors or abortion providers or schoolteachers or even pimps. And yet somehow we managed to write about all that without any horse dung (well, not much at least) flying our way.
  
But Levitt is a schoolteacher (at the University of Chicago)!  And, of course, you don’t have to be a sumo wrestler to be (some kind of an) expert on sumo wrestling, nor do you have to teach in the K-12 system to be an expert in education, nor do you have to provide abortions to be an expert on abortion, etc.  And Levitt has had quite a bit of horse dung thrown at him for the abortion research.  The connection is that abortion and climate change matter to a lot of people, while sumo wrestling and pimps and</p><p>6 0.71702391 <a title="809-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-11-Herman_Chernoff_used_to_do_that_too%3B_also%2C_some_puzzlement_over_another%E2%80%99s_puzzlement_over_another%E2%80%99s_preferences.html">334 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-11-Herman Chernoff used to do that too; also, some puzzlement over another’s puzzlement over another’s preferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I think I’m starting to resolve a puzzle that’s been bugging me for awhile.
 
Pop economists (or, at least, pop micro-economists) are often making one of two arguments:
 
1.  People are rational and respond to incentives.  Behavior that looks irrational is actually completely rational once you think like an economist.
 
2.  People are irrational and they need economists, with their open minds, to show them how to be rational and efficient.
 
Argument 1 is associated with “why do they do that?” sorts of puzzles.  Why do they charge so much for candy at the movie theater, why are airline ticket prices such a mess, why are people drug addicts, etc.  The usual answer is that there’s some rational reason for what seems like silly or self-destructive behavior.
 
Argument 2 is associated with “we can do better” claims such as why we should fire 80% of public-schools teachers or Moneyball-style stories about how some clever entrepreneur has made a zillion dollars by exploiting some inefficienc</p><p>2 0.99766141 <a title="809-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-27-Overfitting.html">1431 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-27-Overfitting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ilya Esteban writes:
  
In traditional machine learning and statistical learning techniques, you spend a lot of time selecting your input features, fiddling with model parameter values, etc., all of which leads to the problem of overfitting the data and producing overly optimistic estimates for how good the model really is. You can use techniques such as cross-validation and out-of-sample validation data to try to limit the damage, but they are imperfect solutions at best.


While Bayesian models have the great advantage of not forcing you to manually select among the various weights and input features, you still often end up trying different priors and model structures (especially with hierarchical models), before coming up with a “final” model. When applying Bayesian modeling to real world data sets, how does should you evaluate alternate priors and topologies for the model without falling into the same overfitting trap as you do with non-Bayesian models?

<p>Introduction: In a link to our  back-and-forth  on causal inference and the use of hierarchical models to bridge between different inferential settings, Elias Bareinboim (a computer scientist who is working with Judea Pearl)  writes :
  
In the past week, I have been engaged in a discussion with Andrew Gelman and his blog readers regarding causal inference, selection bias, confounding, and generalizability. I was trying to understand how his method which he calls “hierarchical modeling” would handle these issues and what guarantees it provides. . . . If anyone understands how “hierarchical modeling” can solve a simple toy problem (e.g., M-bias, control of confounding, mediation, generalizability), please share with us.
  
In his post, Bareinboim raises a direct question about hierarchical modeling and also indirectly brings up larger questions about what is convincing evidence when evaluating a statistical method.  As I wrote earlier, Bareinboim believes that “The only way investigators can decide w</p><p>4 0.99765199 <a title="809-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-17-%E2%80%9Cthe_Tea_Party%E2%80%99s_ire%2C_directed_at_Democrats_and_Republicans_alike%E2%80%9D.html">521 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-17-“the Tea Party’s ire, directed at Democrats and Republicans alike”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Lilla recalls some recent Barack Obama quotes and then  writes :
  
If this is the way the president and his party think about human psychology, it’s little wonder they’ve taken such a beating.
  
In the spirit of that old line, “That and $4.95 will get you a tall latte,” let me agree with Lilla and attribute the Democrats’ losses in 2010 to the following three factors:
 
1.  A poor understanding of human psychology;
 
2.  The Democrats holding unified control of the presidency and congress with a large majority in both houses (factors that are historically associated with big midterm losses); and
 
3.  A terrible economy.
 
I will let you, the readers, make your best guesses as to the relative importance of factors 1, 2, and 3 above.
 
Don’t get me wrong:  I think psychology is important, as is the history of ideas (the main subject of Lilla’s article), and I’d hope that Obama (and also his colleagues in both parties in congress) can become better acquainted with psychology, moti</p><p>5 0.99706566 <a title="809-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-30-More_on_the_correlation_between_statistical_and_political_ideology.html">638 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-30-More on the correlation between statistical and political ideology</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a chance for me to combine two of my interests–politics and statistics–and probably to irritate both halves of the readership of this blog.  Anyway…
 
I recently  wrote  about the apparent correlation between Bayes/non-Bayes statistical ideology and liberal/conservative political ideology:
  
The Bayes/non-Bayes fissure had a bit of a political dimension–with anti-Bayesians being the old-line conservatives (for example, Ronald Fisher) and Bayesians having a more of a left-wing flavor (for example, Dennis Lindley). Lots of counterexamples at an individual level, but my impression is that on average the old curmudgeonly, get-off-my-lawn types were (with some notable exceptions) more likely to be anti-Bayesian.
  
This was somewhat based on my experiences at Berkeley.  Actually, some of the cranky anti-Bayesians were probably Democrats as well, but when they were being anti-Bayesian they seemed pretty conservative.

I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.

</p><p>3 The proponents of exploratory data analysis liked to graph raw data and never think about models. [sent-14, score-0.557]
</p><p>4 I realized this when the New York Times ran a graph and some maps we’d created to show variation in opinion on gay rights. [sent-28, score-0.455]
</p><p>5 There can be several, and there’s no reason to suppose that the graph that is best for achieving one of these goals will be optimal, or even good, for another. [sent-46, score-0.416]
</p><p>6 –and think of them as allies with a common goal of displaying data informatively and attractively. [sent-49, score-0.425]
</p><p>7 I think we have fundamentally different goals, that the statistical goal of understanding data, models, and inferences is different from the infovis goal of creating something new and visually exciting. [sent-64, score-0.651]
</p><p>8 Minimalist graphs such as in Red State Blue State can convey a lot of information to the educated and interested reader but are not so accessible to an outsider. [sent-66, score-0.515]
</p><p>9 I have a new thought on how infovis designers think differently from statisticians when it comes to graphs:   Compare attitudes on pie charts, bubble plots, and dot plots. [sent-68, score-0.943]
</p><p>10 Statisticians such as Bill Cleveland (and myself) hate pie charts, dislike bubble plots (in which the area of the circle is proportional to the quantity being displayed), and love dot plots. [sent-69, score-0.623]
</p><p>11 Almost always, the purpose of a statistical graph is to make comparisons, so we think a lot about how best to do this. [sent-72, score-0.546]
</p><p>12 They think pie charts are OK (for example, Yau discusses how to make a good pie chart in his recent book), and they love bubble plots. [sent-74, score-0.658]
</p><p>13 I think I know, and I think their principle is that graphs should be logical. [sent-77, score-0.436]
</p><p>14 Similarly, if you are displaying quantities, counts, or volumes, a bubble chart is logical because you’re showing physical areas. [sent-80, score-0.406]
</p><p>15 I’m not saying that infovis people are hardliners on this one, just that I think there is a principle here, a principle that also helps to explain the appeal of Florence Nightingale’s famous graph of Crimean war data. [sent-82, score-0.84]
</p><p>16 As Antony Unwin and I have  discussed , we don’t think this a good statistical graph at all (with due respect to Nightingale’s pioneering work). [sent-83, score-0.468]
</p><p>17 I recognize that her graph might have been an effective infographic–even 150 years later it has a visual appeal–but I don’t think it’s a good model for statistical graphics if the goal is to learn something new from data or to convey data patterns to others who are already interested in a topic. [sent-93, score-1.05]
</p><p>18 My first goal is to get statisticians and social science researchers to think more about their goals in displaying numerical information. [sent-98, score-0.552]
</p><p>19 My second goal is for graphics designers and creators of information visualization tools and infographics to become aware of a statistical perspective in which a graph can not only be evocative of data but can also convey quantitative comparisons. [sent-100, score-1.338]
</p><p>20 Appreciating new tools is fine, but I think infovis could also benefit from focused criticism and improvement, which might start with refections on the goals of any graph. [sent-101, score-0.496]

<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.

<p>Introduction: Our discussion on data visualization continues.
 
One one side are three statisticians–Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, and myself.  We have been writing about the different goals served by information visualization and statistical graphics.
 
On the other side are graphics experts (sorry for the imprecision, I don’t know exactly what these people do in their day jobs or how they are trained, and I don’t want to mislabel them) such as  Robert Kosara  and  Jen Lowe , who seem a bit annoyed at how my colleagues and myself seem to follow the Tufte strategy of criticizing what we don’t understand.
 
And on the third side are many (most?) academic statisticians, econometricians, etc., who don’t understand or respect graphs and seem to think of visualization as a toy that is unrelated to serious science or statistics.
 
I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>4 0.35387236 <a title="878-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-19-Tradeoffs_in_information_graphics.html">1584 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-19-Tradeoffs in information graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The visual display of quantitative information (to use Edward Tufte’s wonderful term) is a diverse field or set of fields, and its practitioners have different goals. The goals of software designers, applied statisticians, biologists, graphic designers, and journalists (to list just a few of the important creators of data graphics) often overlap—but not completely. One of our aims in writing  our article  [on Infovis and Statistical Graphics] was to emphasize the diversity of graphical goals, as it seems to us that even experts tend to consider one aspect of a graph and not others.


Our main practical suggestion was that, in the internet age, we should not have to choose between attractive graphs and informational graphs: it should be possible to display both, via interactive displays. But to follow this suggestion, one must first accept that not every beautiful graph is informative, and not every informative graph is beautiful. . . .

<p>Introduction: Details matter (at least, they do for me), but we don’t yet have a systematic way of going back and forth between the structure of a graph, its details, and the underlying questions that motivate our visualizations.  (Cleveland, Wilkinson, and others have written a bit on how to formalize these connections, and I’ve thought about it too, but we have a ways to go.)
 
I was thinking about this difficulty after reading an article on graphics by some computer scientists that was well-written but to me lacked a feeling for the linkages between substantive/statistical goals and graphical details.  I have problems with these issues too, and my point here is not to criticize but to  move the discussion forward.
 
 When thinking about visualization, how important are the details?

<p>Introduction: Dean Eckles writes:
  
Some of my coworkers at Facebook and I have worked with Udacity to create an online course on exploratory data analysis, including using data visualizations in R as part of EDA.


The course has now launched at  https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651  so anyone can take it for free. And Kaiser Fung has  reviewed it . So definitely feel free to promote it! Criticism is also welcome (we are still fine-tuning things and adding more notes throughout).


I wrote some more comments about the course  here , including highlighting the interviews with my great coworkers.
  
I didn’t have a chance to look at the course so instead I responded with some generic comments about eda and visualization  (in no particular order):

<p>Introduction: Here . Indeed, I’d much rather be a legend than a myth.
 
I just want to clarify one thing.  Walter Hickey writes:
  
[Antony Unwin and Andrew Gelman] collaborated on this presentation where they take a hard look at what’s wrong with the recent trends of data visualization and infographics.


The takeaway is that while there have been great leaps in visualization technology, some of the visualizations that have garnered the highest praises have actually been lacking in a number of key areas.


Specifically, the pair does a takedown of the top visualizations of 2008 as decided by the popular statistics blog Flowing Data.
  
This is a fair summary, but I want to emphasize that, although our dislike of some award-winning visualizations is central to our argument, it is only the first part of our story.  As Antony and I worked more on our paper, and especially after seeing the discussions by Robert Kosara, Stephen Few, Hadley Wickham, and Paul Murrell (all to appear in Journal of Computati</p><p>6 0.89001554 <a title="878-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-10-Using_a_%E2%80%9Cpure_infographic%E2%80%9D_to_explore_differences_between_information_visualization_and_statistical_graphics.html">847 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-10-Using a “pure infographic” to explore differences between information visualization and statistical graphics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>2 0.97841823 <a title="878-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-08-P-values_and_statistical_practice.html">1713 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-08-P-values and statistical practice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  my new article  in the journal Epidemiology:
  
Sander Greenland and Charles Poole accept that P values are here to stay but recognize that some of their most common interpretations have problems. The casual view of the P value as posterior probability of the truth of the null hypothesis is false and not even close to valid under any reasonable model, yet this misunderstanding persists even in high-stakes settings (as discussed, for example, by Greenland in 2011). The formal view of the P value as a probability conditional on the null is mathematically correct but typically irrelevant to research goals (hence, the popularity of alternative—if wrong—interpretations). A Bayesian interpretation based on a spike-and-slab model makes little sense in applied contexts in epidemiology, political science, and other fields in which true effects are typically nonzero and bounded (thus violating both the “spike” and the “slab” parts of the model).


I find Greenland and Poole’s perspective t</p><p>3 0.97640336 <a title="878-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-19-Standardized_writing_styles_and_standardized_graphing_styles.html">1176 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-19-Standardized writing styles and standardized graphing styles</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Back in the 1700s—JennyD can correct me if I’m wrong here—there was no standard style for writing.  You could be discursive, you could be descriptive, flowery, or terse.  Direct or indirect, serious or funny.  You could construct a novel out of letters or write a philosophical treatise in the form of a novel.
 
Nowadays there are rules.  You can break the rules, but then you’re Breaking. The. Rules.  Which is a distinctive choice all its own.
 
Consider academic writing.  Serious works of economics or statistics tend to be written in a serious style in some version of plain academic English.  The few exceptions (for example, by Tukey, Tufte, Mandelbrot, and Jaynes) are clearly exceptions, written in styles that are much celebrated but not so commonly followed.
 
A serious work of statistics, or economics, or political science  could  be written in a highly unconventional form (consider, for example, Wallace Shawn’s plays), but academic writers in these fields tend to stick with the sta</p><p>4 0.97583246 <a title="878-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-17-How_to_think_about_the_statistical_evidence_when_the_statistical_evidence_can%E2%80%99t_be_conclusive%3F.html">2174 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-17-How to think about the statistical evidence when the statistical evidence can’t be conclusive?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a paradigm in applied statistics that goes something like this:
 
1.  There is a scientific or policy question of some theoretical or practical importance.
 
2.  Researchers gather data on relevant outcomes and perform a statistical analysis, ideally leading to a clear conclusion (p less than 0.05, or a strong posterior distribution, or good predictive performance, or high reliability and validity, whatever).
 
3.  This conclusion informs policy.
 
This paradigm has room for positive findings (for example, that a new program is statistically significantly better, or statistically significantly worse than what came before) or negative findings (data are inconclusive, further study is needed), even if negative findings seem less likely to make their way into the textbooks.
 
But what happens when step 2 simply isn’t possible.  This came up a few years ago—nearly 10 years ago, now!—with the excellent  paper  by Donohue and Wolfers which explained why it’s just about impossible to</p><p>5 0.97522128 <a title="878-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-07-X_on_JLP.html">1792 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-07-X on JLP</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christian Robert  writes  on the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox.  I have nothing to add to this beyond my recent  comments :
  
To me, the Lindley paradox falls apart because of its noninformative prior distribution on the parameter of interest. If you really think there’s a high probability the parameter is nearly exactly zero, I don’t see the point of the model saying that you have no prior information at all on the parameter. In short: my criticism of so-called Bayesian hypothesis testing is that it’s insufficiently Bayesian.


To clarify, I’m speaking of all the examples I’ve ever worked on in social and environmental science, where in some settings I can imagine a parameter being very close to zero and in other settings I can imagine a parameter taking on just about any value in a wide range, but where I’ve never seen an example where a parameter could be either right at zero or taking on any possible value. But such examples might occur in areas of application that I haven’t worked on.</p><p>6 0.97483587 <a title="878-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-05-More_philosophy_of_Bayes.html">1247 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-05-More philosophy of Bayes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
Michael Graham Richard has  posted some great maps  from the 1932 Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States; the maps show how long it took to get to various places in the U.S. from New York City in 1800, 1830, 1857, and 1930. (I wonder if the atlas has one from around 1900 as well, that didn’t make it into the article? I’d like to see it, too, if it exists.)  Worth a look.

<p>Introduction: 1.
 
We Bayesian statisticians like to say there are three kinds of statisticians:
 
a.  Bayesians; 
b.  People who are Bayesians but don’t realize it (that is, they act in coherence with some unstated probability); 
c.  Failed Bayesians (that is, people whose inference could be improved by some attention to coherence).
 
So, if a statistician does great work, we are inclined to claim this person for the Bayesian cause, even if he or she vehemently denies any Bayesian leanings.

In his autobiography, Bertrand Russell tells the story of when he went to prison for opposing World War 1:
  
I [Russell] was much cheered on my arrival by the warden at the gate, who had to take particulars about me. He asked my religion, and I replied ‘agnostic.’ He asked how to spell it, and remarked with a sigh: “Well, there are many religions, but I suppose they all worship the same God.” This remark kept me cheerful for about a week.

<p>Introduction: In a single day, New York City obtained two data analysis/statistics/machine learning organizations:
  
  Microsoft Research  New York City with  John Langford  (machine learning),  Duncan Watts  (networks), and  Dave Pennock  (algorithmic economics). 
  eBay technology center  focusing on data – led by  Chris Dixon , the co-founder of the recommendation engine company Hunch, which has recently been acquired by eBay. 
  
New York already has Facebook’s engineering  unit , Twitter’s East Coast  headquarters , and Google’s  second-largest  engineering office.
 
The data community here is on an upswing, and it might be one of the best places to be if you’re into applied statistics, machine learning or data analysis.

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>6 0.066572733 <a title="698-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-25-Note_to_student_journalists%3A__Google_is_your_friend.html">1027 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-25-Note to student journalists:  Google is your friend</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When linking to my  review  of Duncan Watts’s book in a recent post, I came across some fun bits that I’d like to share (for those of you who didn’t just click through and read the whole thing):
 
On business books:
  
I’m not so interested in the business angle but I suppose that’s how you sell books these days. The business part of the book was ok—I’m not saying it was filler—it’s just that I’m not particularly interested in which format of videocassette wins, or whether Cisco Systems is a well-run company. I realize that a lot of people care about this sort of things nowadays, but I’d rather talk about sports or politics.
  
On dodgy science writer John Gribbin:
  
Sure, people write all sorts of silly things but usually they have some sort of political or religious excuse for why it’s ok to believe them. Truth is not the only important value in life, there are also other concerns such as political convictions, religious beliefs, and the simple desire to avoid offending people. Thus</p><p>3 0.73637933 <a title="698-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-05-Two_exciting_movie_ideas%3A__%E2%80%9CSecond_Chance_U%E2%80%9D_and_%E2%80%9CThe_New_Dirty_Dozen%E2%80%9D.html">1484 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-05-Two exciting movie ideas:  “Second Chance U” and “The New Dirty Dozen”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have a great idea for a movie.  Actually two movies based on two variants of a similar idea.
 
It all started when I saw this story:
  
Dr. Anil Potti, the controversial cancer researcher whose work at Duke University led to lawsuits from patients, is now a medical oncologist at the Cancer Center of North Dakota in Grand Forks.
  
When asked about Dr. Potti’s controversial appointment, his new boss  said :
  
If a guy can’t get a second chance here in North Dakota, where he trained, man, you can’t get a second chance anywhere.
  
(Link from  Retraction Watch , of course.)
 
Potti’s boss is also quoted as saying, “Most, if not all, his patients have loved him.”  On the other hand, the news article reports: “The North Carolina medical board’s website lists settlements against Potti of at least $75,000.”  I guess there’s no reason you can’t love a guy and still want a juicy malpractice settlement.
 
 Second Chance U 
 
I don’t give two poops about Dr. Anil Potti.  But seeing the above s</p><p>4 0.73107892 <a title="698-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-24-Bell_Labs.html">970 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-24-Bell Labs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sining Chen told me they’re hiring in the  statistics group at Bell Labs .  I’ll do my bit for economic stimulus by announcing this job (see below).
 
I love Bell Labs.  I worked there for three summers, in a physics lab in 1985-86 under the supervision of Loren Pfeiffer, and by myself in the statistics group in 1990.
 
I learned a lot working for Loren.  He was a really smart and driven guy.  His lab was a small set of rooms—in Bell Labs, everything’s in a small room, as they value the positive externality of close physical proximity of different labs, which you get by making each lab compact—and it was Loren, his assistant (a guy named Ken West who kept everything running in the lab), and three summer students: me, Gowton Achaibar, and a girl whose name I’ve forgotten.  Gowtan and I had a lot of fun chatting in the lab.  One day I made a silly comment about Gowton’s accent—he was from Guyana and pronounced “three” as “tree”—and then I apologized and said:  Hey, here I am making fun o</p><p>5 0.71938932 <a title="698-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-12-The_Naval_Research_Lab.html">1261 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-12-The Naval Research Lab</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I worked at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory for four summers during high school and college.  I spent much of my time writing a computer program to do thermal analysis for an experiment that we put on the space shuttle.  The facility I developed with the finite-element method came in handy in my  job  at Bell Labs the following summers.
 
I was working for C. H. Tsao and Jim Adams in the Laboratory for Cosmic Ray Physics.  We were estimating the distribution of isotopes in cosmic rays using a pile of track detectors.  To get accurate measurements, you want these plastic disks to be as close as possible to a constant temperature, so we designed an elaborate wrapping of thermal blankets.  My program computed the temperature of the detectors during the year that the Long Duration Exposure Facility (including our experiment and a bunch of others) was scheduled to be in orbit.

<p>Introduction: Much-honored playwright Tony Kushner was set to receive one more honor–a degree from John Jay College–but it was suddenly  taken away  from him on an 11-1 vote of the trustees  of the City University of New York.  This was the first rejection of an honorary degree nomination since 1961.
 
The news article focuses on one trustee, Jeffrey Wiesenfeld, an investment adviser and onetime political aide, who opposed Kushner’s honorary degree, but to me the relevant point is that the committee as a whole voted 11-1 to ding him.
 
Kusnher said, “I’m sickened,” he added, “that this is happening in New York City. Shocked, really.”  I can see why he’s shocked, but perhaps it’s not so surprising that it’s happening in NYC.  Recall the famous incident from 1940 in which Bertrand Russell was invited and then uninvited to teach at City College.  The problem that time was Russell’s views on free love (as they called it back then).  There seems to be a long tradition of city college officials being will</p><p>2 0.91199386 <a title="698-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-18-Should_kids_be_able_to_bring_their_own_lunches_to_school%3F.html">718 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-18-Should kids be able to bring their own lunches to school?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I encountered this  news article , “Chicago school bans some lunches brought from home”:
  
At Little Village, most students must take the meals served in the cafeteria or go hungry or both. . . . students are not allowed to pack lunches from home. Unless they have a medical excuse, they must eat the food served in the cafeteria. . . . Such discussions over school lunches and healthy eating echo a larger national debate about the role government should play in individual food choices.  “This is such a fundamental infringement on parental responsibility,” said J. Justin Wilson, a senior researcher at the Washington-based Center for Consumer Freedom, which is partially funded by the food industry. . . . For many CPS parents, the idea of forbidding home-packed lunches would be unthinkable. . . . 
  
If I had read this two years ago, I’d be at one with J. Justin Wilson and the outraged kids and parents.  But last year we spent a sabbatical in Paris, where . . . kids aren’t allowed to bring</p><p>3 0.90674001 <a title="698-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-22-Researching_the_cost-effectiveness_of_political_lobbying_organisations.html">969 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-22-Researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sally Murray from  Giving What We Can  writes:
  
We are an organisation that assesses different charitable (/fundable) interventions, to estimate which are the most cost-effective (measured in terms of the improvement of life for people in developing countries gained for every dollar invested). Our research guides and encourages greater donations to the most cost-effective charities we thus identify, and our members have so far pledged a total of $14m to these causes, with many hundreds more relying on our advice in a less formal way.


I am specifically researching the cost-effectiveness of political lobbying organisations. We are initially focusing on organisations that lobby for ‘big win’ outcomes such as increased funding of the most cost-effective NTD treatments/ vaccine research, changes to global trade rules (potentially) and more obscure lobbies such as “Keep Antibiotics Working”.

<p>Introduction: As we said in Red State, Blue State, it’s not the Prius vs. the pickup truck, it’s the Prius vs. the Hummer.  Here’s the graph:
 
 
 
Or, as Ross Douthat put it in  an op-ed  yesterday:
  
This means that a culture war that’s often seen as a clash between liberal elites and a conservative middle America looks more and more like a conflict within the educated class — pitting Wheaton and Baylor against Brown and Bard, Redeemer Presbyterian Church against the 92nd Street Y, C. S. Lewis devotees against the Philip Pullman fan club.
  
Our main motivation for doing this work was to change how the news media think about America’s political divisions, and so it’s good to see our ideas getting mainstreamed and moving toward conventional wisdom.
  

 
P.S.  Here’s the time series of graphs showing how the pattern that we and Douthat noticed, of a battle between coastal states and middle America that is occurring among upper-income Americans, is relatively recent, having arisen in the Clinton ye</p><p>5 0.89323789 <a title="698-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-20-Maybe_a_great_idea_in_theory%2C_didn%E2%80%99t_work_so_well_in_practice.html">621 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-20-Maybe a great idea in theory, didn’t work so well in practice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I followed the link of  commenter  “Epanechnikov” to his blog, where I found, among other things, an uncritical  discussion  of Richard von Mises’s book, “Probability, Statistics and Truth.”
 
The bad news is that, based on the evidence of his book, Mises didn’t seem to understand basic ideas of statistical significance.  See  here,   Or at the very least, he was grossly overconfident (which can perhaps be seen from the brash title of his book).  This is not  the fault of “Epanechnikov,” but I just thought that people should be careful about taking too seriously the statistical philosophy of someone who didn’t think to do a chi-squared test when it was called for.  (This is not a Bayesian/non-Bayesian thing; it’s just basic statistics.)</p><p>6 0.87706727 <a title="698-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-25-Calibration%21.html">1183 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-25-Calibration!</a></p>

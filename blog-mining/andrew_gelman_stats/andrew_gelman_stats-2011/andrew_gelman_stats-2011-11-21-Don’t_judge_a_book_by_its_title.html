<p>Introduction: I’ve become increasingly uncomfortable with the term “confidence interval,” for several reasons:
 
- The well-known difficulties in interpretation (officially the confidence statement can be interpreted only on average, but people typically implicitly give the Bayesian interpretation to each case),
 
- The ambiguity between confidence intervals and predictive intervals.  (See the footnote in BDA where we discuss the difference between “inference” and “prediction” in the classical framework.)
 
- The awkwardness of explaining that confidence intervals are big in noisy situations where you have  less  confidence, and confidence intervals are small when you have  more  confidence.
 
So here’s my proposal.  Let’s use the term “uncertainty interval” instead.  The uncertainty interval tells you how much uncertainty you have.  That works pretty well, I think.
 
P.S.  As of this writing, “confidence interval” outGoogles “uncertainty interval” by the huge margin of 9.5 million to 54000.  So we</p><p>3 0.14418031 <a title="1021-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-17-I_got_99_comparisons_but_multiplicity_ain%E2%80%99t_one.html">1016 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-17-I got 99 comparisons but multiplicity ain’t one</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After I gave  my talk  at an econ seminar on Why We (Usually) Don’t Care About Multiple Comparisons, I got the following comment:
  
One question that came up later was whether your argument is really with testing in general, rather than only with testing in multiple comparison settings.
  
My reply:
 
Yes, my argument is with testing in general.  But it arises with particular force in multiple comparisons.  With a single test, we can just say we dislike testing so we use confidence intervals or Bayesian inference instead, and it’s no problem—really more of a change in emphasis than a change in methods.  But with multiple tests, the classical advice is not simply to look at type 1 error rates but more specifically to make a multiplicity adjustment, for example to make confidence intervals wider to account for multiplicity.  I don’t want to do this!  So here there is a real battle to fight.

<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>5 0.13790077 <a title="1021-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-24-Why_it_doesn%E2%80%99t_make_sense_in_general_to_form_confidence_intervals_by_inverting_hypothesis_tests.html">1913 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-24-Why it doesn’t make sense in general to form confidence intervals by inverting hypothesis tests</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m reposing  this  classic from 2011 . . . Peter Bergman pointed me to  this discussion  from Cyrus of  a presentation  by Guido Imbens on design of randomized experiments.
 
Cyrus writes:
  
The standard analysis that Imbens proposes includes (1) a Fisher-type permutation test of the sharp null hypothesis–what Imbens referred to as “testing”–along with a (2) Neyman-type point estimate of the sample average treatment effect and confidence interval–what Imbens referred to as “estimation.” . . .


Imbens claimed that testing and estimation are separate enterprises with separate goals and that the two should not be confused. I [Cyrus] took it as a warning against proposals that use “inverted” tests in order to produce point estimates and confidence intervals. There is no reason that such confidence intervals will have accurate coverage except under rather dire assumptions, meaning that they are not “confidence intervals” in the way that we usually think of them.
  
I agree completely.

<p>Introduction: I followed the link of  commenter  “Epanechnikov” to his blog, where I found, among other things, an uncritical  discussion  of Richard von Mises’s book, “Probability, Statistics and Truth.”
 
The bad news is that, based on the evidence of his book, Mises didn’t seem to understand basic ideas of statistical significance.  See  here,   Or at the very least, he was grossly overconfident (which can perhaps be seen from the brash title of his book).  This is not  the fault of “Epanechnikov,” but I just thought that people should be careful about taking too seriously the statistical philosophy of someone who didn’t think to do a chi-squared test when it was called for.  (This is not a Bayesian/non-Bayesian thing; it’s just basic statistics.)</p><p>3 0.67979491 <a title="1021-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-13-Visualization_in_1939.html">31 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-13-Visualization in 1939</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Psychology researcher Chris Chabris  writes :
  
Rolf Dobelli, a Swiss writer, published a book called The Art of Thinking Clearly earlier this year with HarperCollins in the U.S. The book’s original German edition was a #1 bestseller, and the book has sold over one million copies worldwide.


In perusing Mr. Dobelli’s book, we noticed several familiar-sounding passages. On closer examination, we found five instances of unattributed material that is either reproduced verbatim or closely paraphrased from text and arguments in our book, The Invisible Gorilla (Crown, 2010). They are listed at the end of this note.
  
Apparently he ripped off Nassim Taleb  too .
 
A million copies, huh?  I guess crime really does pay!  Maybe he could get an appointment at  Harvard Law School  or, if that falls through, a position as writer-in-residence at the statistics department of George Mason University [no link needed for that one -- ed.].

<p>Introduction: Ben points us to a new book,  Flexible Imputation of Missing Data .  It’s excellent and I highly recommend it.  Definitely worth the $89.95.  Van Buuren’s book is great even if you don’t end up using the algorithm described in the book (I actually like their approach but I do think there are some limitations with their particular implementation, which is one reason we’re developing our own  package ); he supplies lots of intuition, examples, and graphs. 
   
P.S.

<p>Introduction: OK, here’s something that is completely baffling me.  I read  this article  by John Colapinto on the neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran, who’s famous for his innovative treatment for “phantom limb” pain:
  
His first subject was a young man who a decade earlier had crashed his motorcycle and torn from his spinal column the nerves supplying the left arm.  After keeping the useless arm in a sling for a year, the man had the arm amputated above the elbow.  Ever since, he had felt unremitting cramping in the phantom limb, as though it were immobilized in an awkward position. . . . Ramachandram positioned a twenty-inch-by-twenty-inch drugstore mirror . . . and told him to place his intact right arm on one side of the mirror and his stump on the other.  He told the man to arrange the mirror so that the reflection created the illusion that his intact arm was the continuation of the amputated one.  The Ramachandran asked the man to move his right and left arms . . . “Oh, my God!” the man began</p><p>2 0.95001739 <a title="1021-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-22-Improvements_to_Kindle_Version_of_BDA3.html">1993 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-22-Improvements to Kindle Version of BDA3</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I let Andrew know about the comments about the defective Kindle version of BDA2 and he wrote to his editor at Chapman and Hall, Rob Calver, who wrote back with this info:
  

I can guarantee that the Kindle version of the third edition will be a substantial improvement.


We publish all of our mathematics and statistics books through Kindle now as Print Replica. This means that we send the printer pdf to Amazon and they convert into their Print Replica format, which is essentially just a pdf viewer. We have not experienced very many issues at all with this setup.


Unfortunately, there was a period before Amazon launched Print Replica when they converted math/stat books into their Kindle format, and converted them very badly in some cases. Equations were held as images, making them very difficult to read. It appears this was the case with Andrew’s second edition, judging by some of the comments.


The third edition [of BDA] will be available through Kindle with a short delay (for Amazo</p><p>same-blog 3 0.92515922 <a title="1021-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-21-Don%E2%80%99t_judge_a_book_by_its_title.html">1021 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-21-Don’t judge a book by its title</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A correspondent writes:
  
I just want to spend a few words to point you to this book I have just found on Amazon:  “Understanding The New Statistics: Effect Sizes, Confidence Intervals, and Meta-Analysis” by G. Cumming.  I have been attracted by the rather unusual and ‘sexy’ title but it seems to be nothing more than an attempt at alerting the psychology community on considering point estimation procedures and confidence intervals, in place of hypothesis testing, the latter being ‘a terrible idea!’ in the author’s own words.


Some more quotes  here .  Then he says: “‘These are hardly new techniques, but I label them ‘The New Statistics’ because using them would for many researchers be quite new, as well as a highly beneficial change!’”


Of course the latter is not stated on the book cover.
  
That’s about as bad as writing a book with subtitle, “Why Americans vote the way they do,” but not actually telling the reader why Americans vote the way they do.
 
I guess what I’m saying is:</p><p>4 0.92330283 <a title="1021-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-23-Special_effects.html">1426 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-23-Special effects</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just saw L’Age de Glace 4 and boy are my eyes tired.  I’m just glad it wasn’t in 3-D or I probably would’ve thrown up.  The special effects were amazing, way beyond George of the Jungle and that ilk.  Which was good, as I could only understand about 10% of the dialogue.

<p>Introduction: Stan 1.0.0 and RStan 1.0.0 
 
It’s official.  The Stan Development Team is happy to announce the first stable versions of Stan and RStan.  
 
 What is (R)Stan? 
 
Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  It’s sort of like BUGS, but with a different language for expressing models and a different sampler for sampling from their posteriors. 
 
RStan is the R interface to Stan.  
 
 Stan Home Page 
 
Stan’s home page is:     http://mc-stan.org/    
 
It links everything you need to get started running Stan from the command line, from R, or from C++, including full step-by-step install instructions, a detailed user’s guide and reference manual for the modeling language, and tested ports of most of the BUGS examples.
 
 Peruse the Manual 
 
If you’d like to learn more, the   Stan User’s Guide and Reference Manual   is the place to start.</p><p>6 0.92052358 <a title="1021-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-04-%E2%80%9CAll_Models_are_Right%2C_Most_are_Useless%E2%80%9D.html">1197 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-04-“All Models are Right, Most are Useless”</a></p>

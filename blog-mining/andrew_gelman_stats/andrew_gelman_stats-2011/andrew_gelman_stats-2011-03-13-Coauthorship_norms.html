<p>Introduction: The other day I  posted  some remarks on Stan Liebowitz’s analysis of coauthorship in economics.  Liebowitz followed up with some more thoughts:
  
I [Liebowitz] am not arguing for an increase or decrease in coauthorship, per se. I would prefer an efficient amount of coauthorship, whatever that is, and certainly it will vary by paper and by field. If you feel you are more productive with many coauthors, that is not in contrast to anything in my paper. My point is that you will pick the correct number of coauthors if you and your coauthors are given 1/n credit (assuming you believe each author contributed equally). If, however, all of the coauthors are given full credit for the paper (and I have evidence that, in economics at least, authors are far more likely to receive full credit than 1/n credit), authors will get credit for more papers if they use more coauthors than would otherwise be best for total research productivity. My criticism is in the inefficiency induced by not using 1/n</p><p>3 0.15252765 <a title="609-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-23-More_on_those_L.A._Times_estimates_of_teacher_effectiveness.html">226 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-23-More on those L.A. Times estimates of teacher effectiveness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In discussing the ongoing Los Angeles Times series on teacher effectiveness, Alex Tabarrok and I both were impressed that the newspaper was reporting results on individual teachers, moving beyond the general research findings (“teachers matter,” “KIPP really works, but it requires several extra hours in the school day,” and so forth) that we usually see from value-added analyses in education.  My first reaction was that the L.A. Times could get away with this because, unlike academic researchers, they can do whatever they want as long as they don’t break the law.  They don’t have to answer to an Institutional Review Board.
 
(By referring to this study by its publication outlet rather than its authors, I’m violating my usual rule (see the last paragraph  here ).  In this case, I think it’s ok to refer to the “L.A. Times study” because what’s notable is not the analysis (thorough as it may be) but how it is being reported.)

<p>Introduction: Chris Paulse points me to  this book  by Ruth Grant:
  
Incentives can be found everywhere–in schools, businesses, factories, and government–influencing people’s choices about almost everything, from financial decisions and tobacco use to exercise and child rearing. So long as people have a choice, incentives seem innocuous. But Strings Attached demonstrates that when incentives are viewed as a kind of power rather than as a form of exchange, many ethical questions arise: How do incentives affect character and institutional culture? Can incentives be manipulative or exploitative, even if people are free to refuse them? What are the responsibilities of the powerful in using incentives? Ruth Grant shows that, like all other forms of power, incentives can be subject to abuse, and she identifies their legitimate and illegitimate uses.


Grant offers a history of the growth of incentives in early twentieth-century America, identifies standards for judging incentives, and examines incentives</p><p>5 0.13242529 <a title="609-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-13-Test_scores_and_grades_predict_job_performance_%28but_maybe_not_at_Google%29.html">1980 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-13-Test scores and grades predict job performance (but maybe not at Google)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Loken  writes :
  
If you’re used to Google upending conventional wisdom, then yesterday’s  interview with Laszlo Bock in the New York Times  did not disappoint. Google has determined that test scores and transcripts are useless because they don’t predict performance among its employees. . . .


I [Loken] am going to assume they’re well aware of the limits of their claim, and instead I’m going say that as readers of the interview we should not lose sight of a fundamental fact -

 
Across a wide variety of employment settings, one of the most robust findings in organizational psychology is that tests of cognitive ability are strong predictors of job performance. If Google has found otherwise, what they have found is that grades and test scores are not predictive of performance at Google. In general, in the workplace tests are still highly predictive of success.
 
  
If all the research says that test scores and grades predict performance, why would the people at Google want to igno</p><p>6 0.12203711 <a title="609-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-14-Causal_inference_in_economics.html">32 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-14-Causal inference in economics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Theodore Vasiloudis writes:
  
I came upon  this article  by Laura Hamilton, an assistant professor in the University of California at Merced, that claims that “The more money that parents provide for higher education, the lower the grades their children earn.”


I can’t help but feel that there something wrong with the basis of the study or a confounding factor causing this apparent correlation, and since you often comment on studies on your blog I thought you might find this study interesting.
  
My reply:  I have to admit that the description above made me suspicious of the study before I even looked at it.  On first thought, I’d expect the effect of parent’s financial contributions to be positive (as they free the student from the need to get a job during college), but not negative.  Hamilton argues that “parental investments create a disincentive for student achievement,” which may be—but I’m generally suspicious of arguments in which the rebound is bigger than the main effect.</p><p>3 0.7685886 <a title="609-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-15-Progress_in_U.S._education%3B_also%2C_a_discussion_of_what_it_takes_to_hit_the_op-ed_pages.html">1265 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-15-Progress in U.S. education; also, a discussion of what it takes to hit the op-ed pages</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>4 0.75349778 <a title="609-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-24-Chasing_the_noise%3A__W._Edwards_Deming_would_be_spinning_in_his_grave.html">2076 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-24-Chasing the noise:  W.

A surgeon showed me the “report card” his hospital received about his surgical group. The figure below shows what the report card looks like. I am very curious to hear what you think about the “deciles of the odds ratio” approach to evaluate and rank hospitals used by the American College of Surgeons.


 
  
I replied:  I don’t know enough about the substantive context to say too much here.  But, speaking generally, I am skeptical of those very high values for some of those odds ratios.  I suspect that much of what is plotted in this graph is just noise.  But I respect the goals underlying the plot, and I like that it displays a lot of information efficiently.
 
And then she wrote:
  
My concern with the decile approach to identifying opportunities for improvement is that it violates a principle of quality improvement: chasing noise is fruitless or worse, because it leads to tampering with a system in a way that can make it worse.

<p>Introduction: Several years ago, I heard about a project at the Educational Testing Service to  identify “strivers”:  students from disadvantaged backgrounds who did unexpectedly well on the SAT (the college admissions exam formerly known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” but apparently now just “the SAT,” in the same way that Exxon is just “Exxon” and that Harry Truman’s middle name is just “S”), at least 200 points above a predicted score based on demographic and neighborhood information.  My ETS colleague and I agreed that this was a silly idea:  From a statistical point of view, if student A is expected ahead of time to do better than student B, and then they get identical test scores, then you’d expect student A (the non-”striver”) to do better than student B (the “striver”) later on.  Just basic statistics:  if a student does much better than expected, then probably some of that improvement is noise.  The idea of identifying these “strivers” seemed misguided and not the best use of the SAT.</p><p>6 0.73757285 <a title="609-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-28-Value-added_assessment%3A__What_went_wrong%3F.html">1350 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-28-Value-added assessment:  What went wrong?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a  discussion  of workplace segregation, Philip Cohen posts some graphs that led me to a statistical question.
 
I’ll pose my question below, but first the graphs:
 
   
 
   
 
In a world of zero segregation of jobs by sex, the top graph above would have a spike at 50% (or, whatever the actual percentage is of women in the labor force) and, in the bottom graph, the pink and blue lines would be in the same place and would look like very steep S curves.  The difference between the pink and blue lines represents segregation by job.
 
One thing I wonder is how these graphs would change if we redefine occupation.  (For example, is my occupation “mathematical scientist,” “statistician,” “teacher,” “university professor,” “statistics professor,” or “tenured statistics professor”?)  Finer or coarser classification would give different results, and I wonder how this would work.
 
This is not at all meant as a criticism of Cohen’s claims, it’s just a statistical question.  I’m guessing that</p><p>2 0.98805481 <a title="609-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-24-ESPN_is_looking_to_hire_a_research_analyst.html">1279 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-24-ESPN is looking to hire a research analyst</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is somebody’s dream job, I’m sure . . .
  
ESPN is looking for a statistician to join the HR department as a  Research Analyst . The job will consist of analytical research and producing statistics about the people that work at ESPN. Topics of interest will include productivity, efficiency, and retention of employees, among other items. In addition to data mining and producing reports, we also field surveys and analyze results.


The position is located at the headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, the same campus where nearly all ESPN shows are produced. ESPN is a Disney company, so discounts and free admission to Disney parks are available for employees. Flexible work arrangements are available, along with working in the New York City office part-time if desired.


The role is a relatively new function and will have a high impact very quickly on helping the business function. Statistical software, text books, and any other resource needed to get the job done will be provided.

<p>Introduction: Malecki asks:
  
Is  this  the worst infographic ever to appear in NYT?  USA Today is not something to aspire to.
  
To connect to some of our recent  themes , I agree this is a pretty horrible data display.  But it’s not bad as a series of images.  Considering the competition to be a cartoon or series of photos, these images aren’t so bad.
 
One issue, I think, is that designers get credit for creativity and originality (unusual color combinations!  Histogram bars shaped like mosques!) , which is often the opposite of what we want in a clear graph.  It’s Martin Amis vs. George Orwell all over again.</p><p>4 0.9775607 <a title="609-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-12-Where_are_the_larger-than-life_athletes%3F.html">1115 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-12-Where are the larger-than-life athletes?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Cantor  points  to this  poll  estimating rifle-armed QB Tim Tebow as America’s favorite pro athlete:
  
In an ESPN survey of 1,502 Americans age 12 or older, three percent identified Tebow as their favorite professional athlete.  Tebow finished in front of Kobe Bryant (2 percent), Aaron Rodgers (1.9 percent), Peyton Manning (1.8 percent), and Tom Brady (1.5 percent).
  
Amusing.  What this survey says to me is that there are no super-popular athletes who are active in America today.  Which actually sounds about right.  No Tiger Woods, no Magic Johnson, Muhammed Ali, John Elway, Pete Rose, Billie Jean King, etc etc.  Tebow is an amusing choice, people might as well pick him now while he’s still on top.  As a sports celeb, he’s like Bill Lee or the Refrigerator:  colorful and a solid pro athlete, but no superstar.
 
When you think about all the colorful superstar athletes of times gone by, it’s perhaps surprising that there’s nobody out there right now to play the role.  I supp</p><p>5 0.97006875 <a title="609-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-08-Animated_drought_maps.html">1487 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-08-Animated drought maps</a></p>

I’m not so happy with the arrangement of years by decade—the lineup of all years ending in 0, or 1, or 2, etc., seems a bit of a distraction—but in many ways the display is impressive.  And, as often is the case with such graphs, once it’s out there, other people can do similar things and make their own improvements.</p><p>6 0.96814913 <a title="609-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-22-I%E2%80%99m_officially_no_longer_a_%E2%80%9Crogue%E2%80%9D.html">1180 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-22-I’m officially no longer a “rogue”</a></p>

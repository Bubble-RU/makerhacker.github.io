<p>Introduction: Back when I taught at Berkeley, I once asked a Ph.D. student how he’d decided to work with me.  He said that a couple of the tenured professors had advised him not to take my class, and that this advice had got him curious:  What about  Bayesian statistics is so dangerous that it can scare these otherwise unflappable stat professors.  Overall, my senior colleagues’ advice to students to avoid my course probably decreased my enrollment, but the students who  did  decide to attend surely had better character than the ones who followed directions.  (Or, at least I’d like to think that.)
 
I was reminded of that incident recently when reading a  news article  by Marc Tracy:
  
A U.S. Department of Education committee is investigating whether a Columbia University department head “steered” a Jewish student away from taking a class on the Mideast taught by Professor Joseph Massad due to the perception that she would be “uncomfortable” because of the professor’s pro-Palestinian tilt . . . “Ba</p><p>3 0.11523218 <a title="1002-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-13-A_departmental_wiki_page%3F.html">571 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-13-A departmental wiki page?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was recently struggling with the Columbia University philophy department’s webpage (to see who might be interested in  this stuff ).  The faculty  webpage  was horrible:  it’s just a list of names and links with no information on research interests.  So I did some searching on the web and found a  wonderful  wikipedia page which had exactly what I wanted.
 
Then I checked my own department’s  page , and it’s even worse than what they have in philosophy!  (We also have  this  page, which is even worse in that it omits many of our faculty and has a bunch of ridiculously technical links for some of the faculty who are included.)
 
I don’t know about the philosophy department, but the statistics department’s webpage is an overengineered mess, designed from the outset to look pretty rather than to be easily updated.  Maybe we could replace it entirely with a wiki?
 
In the meantime, if anybody feels like setting up a wikipedia entry for the research of Columbia’s statistics faculty, that</p><p>4 0.10710336 <a title="1002-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-18-A_course_in_sample_surveys_for_political_science.html">2175 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-18-A course in sample surveys for political science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A colleague asked if I had any material for a course in sample surveys.  And indeed I do.   See here .
 
It’s all the slides for a 14-week course, also the syllabus (“surveyscourse.pdf”), the final exam (“final2012.pdf”) and various misc files. Also more discussion of final exam questions  here  (keep scrolling thru the “previous entries” until you get to Question 1).
 
Enjoy!  This is in no way a self-contained teach-it-yourself course, but I do think it could be helpful for anyone who is trying to teach a class on this material.</p><p>5 0.10236614 <a title="1002-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-01-What_goes_around_._._..html">548 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-01-What goes around . . .</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I delivered a 10-minute talk on statistical graphics that went so well, it was the best-received talk I’ve ever given.  The crowd was raucous.  Then some poor sap had to go on after me.  He started by saying that my talk was a hard act to follow.  And, indeed, the audience politely listened but did not really get involved in his presentation.  Boy did I feel smug.
 
More recently I gave a talk on Stan, at an entirely different venue.  And this time the story was the exact opposite.  Jim Demmel spoke first and gave a wonderful talk on optimization for linear algebra (it was an applied math conference).  Then I followed, and I never really grabbed the crowd.  My talk was not a disaster but it didn’t really work.  This was particularly frustrating because I’m really excited about Stan and this was a group of researchers I wouldn’t usually have a chance to reach.  It was the plenary session at the conference.
 
Anyway, now I know how that guy felt from last month.

When you’re on the hangout, please mute your own microphone!
 
I’ll have the computer point at the blackboard.  You can follow along with the slides:
 
 for the first hour 
 
 for the second hour 
 
P.S.  Apparently there is some limit on number of hangout participants (see comments).  I didn’t know about that!  Maybe next time will try “on air” hangout, I will have to learn more about this.
 
Next week the teaching asst will do the course so no hangout, then in two weeks there is no class because it’s the day after Halloween and that’s a holiday around here.  So we’ll resume this on Fri 8 Nov.  See you then!
 
P.P.S.  Those of you who were able to join the hangout:  Could you please let me know how the visual and sound quality were?

<p>Introduction: This is just a local Columbia thing, so I’m posting Sunday night when nobody will read it . . .
 
Samantha Cooney  reports  in the Spectator (Columbia’s student newspaper):
  
Frontiers of Science may be in for an overhaul. 


After a year reviewing the course, the Educational Policy and Planning Committee has issued a report detailing its findings and outlining potential ways to make the oft-maligned course more effective. The EPPC’s report, a copy of which was obtained by Spectator, suggests eliminating the lecture portion of the course in favor of small seminars with a standardized curriculum, mirroring other courses in the Core Curriculum.
  
This seems reasonable to me.  It sounds like the seminar portion of the class has been much more successful than the lectures.  Once the lectures are removed entirely, perhaps it will allow the students to focus on learning during the seminar periods.
 
Also, I appreciate that Cooney did a good job quoting me.

<p>Introduction: Having been annoyed for  awhile  at those in-your-face internet gurus such as Seth Godin, Clay Shirky, Philip Greenspun, Jeff Jarvis, I was happy to come across  this bit  of Godin-bashing from Tom Slee.  I’m sure Godin has some valuable insights, but I hate that in-your-face style, and I’m glad to see someone go to the trouble of pointing out all the nonsensical bits.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89297736 <a title="1002-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-10-%E2%80%9CVenetia_Orcutt%2C_GWU_med_school_professor%2C_quits_after_complaints_of_no-show_class%E2%80%9D.html">1002 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-10-“Venetia Orcutt, GWU med school professor, quits after complaints of no-show class”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: She was  assigned to teach a class in “evidence-based medicine”!  ( link  from my usual news source).
 
I wonder what was in the syllabus?  If anyone has a copy, feel free to send to me and I will post it here.
 
My favorite part of the story, though, is this:
  
Almost all physician assistant students refused to comment to a reporter Tuesday, saying they’d been told by the department not to talk to media.
  
Talk about obedience to authority!  They’re studying in a program that offers nonexistent courses, but then they follow the department’s gag order.</p><p>3 0.84271264 <a title="1002-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-02-Note_to_the_quals.html">124 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-02-Note to the quals</a></p>

Under what models is this a piece of evidence that the true effect is small?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Paul Pudaite writes in response to  my discussion with Bartels  regarding effect sizes and measurement error models:
  
You [Gelman] wrote: “I actually think there will be some (non-Gaussian) models for which, as y gets larger, E(x|y) can actually go back toward zero.”


I [Pudaite] encountered this phenomenon some time in the ’90s. See this graph which shows the conditional expectation of X given Z, when Z = X + Y and the probability density functions of X and Y are, respectively, exp(-x^2) and 1/(y^2+1) (times appropriate constants). As the magnitude of Z increases, E[X|Z] shrinks to zero.


 


I wasn’t sure it was worth the effort to try to publish a two paragraph paper.


I suspect that this is true whenever the tail of one distribution is ‘sufficiently heavy’ with respect to the tail of the other. Hmm, I suppose there might be enough substance in a paper that attempted to characterize this outcome for, say, unimodal symmetric distributions.
  
Maybe someone can do this? I think i</p><p>5 0.75048172 <a title="1002-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-16-Bayesian_analogue_to_stepwise_regression%3F.html">1535 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-16-Bayesian analogue to stepwise regression?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes:
  
On pp. 250-251 of BDA second edition, you write about multiple comparisons, and you write about stepwise regression on p. 405.  How would you look at stepwise regression analyses in light of the multiple comparisons problem?  Is there an issue?
  
My reply:
 
In this case I think the right approach is to keep all the coefs but partially pool them toward 0 (after suitable transformation).  But then the challenge is coming up with a general way to construct good prior distributions.  Iâ&euro;&trade;m still thinking about that one!  Yet another approach is to put something together purely nonparametrically as with Bart.</p><p>6 0.74730921 <a title="1002-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-07-A_compelling_reason_to_go_to_London%2C_Ontario%3F%3F.html">1104 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-07-A compelling reason to go to London, Ontario??</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Following  my talk  on infovis and statistical graphics at the  Empirical Legal Studies conference , Dan Kahan writes:
  
The legal academy, which is making strides toward sensible integration of a variety of empirical methods into its scholarship, is horribly ignorant of the utility of graphic reporting of data, a likely influence of the formative influence that econometric methods has exerted on expectations and habits of mind among legal scholars. Lee Epstein has written a pair of wonderful articles on graphic reporting –

2.	Epstein, L., Martin, A. & Schneider, M. On the Effective Communication of the Results of Empirical Studies, Part I. Vand. L. Rev. 59, 1811-1871 (2007).

In keeping with your interest in graphs,  this  might interest or inspire you, if you haven’t seen it already, which features 20 scientific graphs that Wired likes, ranging from drawn illustrations to trajectory plots.
  
My reaction:
 
I looked at the first 10. 
I liked 1, 3, and 5, 
I didn’t like 2, 7, 8, 9, and 10. 
I have neutral feelings about 4 and 6.
 
I won’t explain all these feelings, but, just for example, from my perspective, image 9 fails as a statistical graphic (although it might be fine as an infovis) by trying to cram to much into a single image.  I don’t think it works to have all the colors on the single wheels; instead I’d prefer some sort of grid of images.  Also, I don’t see the point of the circular display.  That makes no sense at all; it’s a misleading feature.
 
That said, the graphs I dislike can still be fine for their purpose.

For 2013, we asked some of the year’s most interesting, important and influential thinkers to name their favorite graph of the year — and why they chose it. Here’s Bill Gates’s.

“I love this graph because it shows that while the number of people dying from communicable diseases is still far too high, those numbers continue to come down. . . .”
  
As Brendan is aware, this is not my favorite sort of graph, it’s a bit of a puzzle to read and figure out where all the pieces fit in, also weird stuff going on like 3-D effects and the big space taken up by those yellow and green borders, as well as tricky things like understanding what some of those little blocks are, and perhaps the biggest question, what is the definition of an “untimely death.”  But, as often is the case, the defects of the graph form a statistical perspective can</p><p>6 0.1413065 <a title="832-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-26-Worst_statistical_graphic_I_have_seen_this_year.html">681 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-26-Worst statistical graphic I have seen this year</a></p>

Here are some of the comments on the linked page:
 
 
 
Rather than redrawing the picture to make the lines more clear, I’d say:  leave the graphic as is, and have a link to a set of statistical graphs that show where the different sorts of old trees are and what they look like.  Let’s value the above image for its clean look and its clever Christmas-tree design, and once we have it, take advantage of viewers’ interest in the topic to show them more.
 
P.S.  See my  comment  below which I think further illuminates the appeal of this particular tree.</p><p>4 0.6489917 <a title="832-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-29-Decision_science_vs._social_psychology.html">305 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-29-Decision science vs. social psychology</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Goldstein sends along  this bit of research , distinguishing terms used in two different subfields of psychology.  Dan writes:
  
Intuitive calls included not listing words that don’t occur 3 or more times in both programs. I [Dan] did this because when I looked at the results, those cases tended to be proper names or arbitrary things like header or footer text.  It also narrowed down the space of words to inspect, which means I could actually get the thing done in my copious free time.
  
I think the bar graphs are kinda ugly, maybe there’s a better way to do it based on classifying the words according to content?  Also the whole exercise would gain a new dimension by comparing several areas instead of just two.  Maybe that’s coming next.</p><p>5 0.63801157 <a title="832-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-05-Different_goals%2C_different_looks%3A__Infovis_and_the_Chris_Rock_effect.html">787 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-05-Different goals, different looks:  Infovis and the Chris Rock effect</a></p>

 Here’s  my candidate for bad graphic of the year:


   


I [Seth] studied it and learned nothing. I have no idea how they assigned colors to locations. I already knew that there were more within-city calls than calls to individual distant locations — for example that there are more SF-SF calls than SF-LA calls. The researchers took a huge rich database and boiled it down to nothing (in terms of information value) — and I have a funny feeling they don’t realize how awful this is and what a waste.


I send it to you because it isn’t obvious how to do better — at least not obvious to them.
  
My reply:
 
My first reaction is to agree–I don’t get anything out of this graph either! But let me step back.
 
I think it’s best to understand this using the framework of  my paper with Antony Unwin , by thinking of the goals that are satisfied by different sorts of graphs.

<p>Introduction: When I first saw this graphic, I thought “boy, that’s great, sometimes the graphic practically makes itself.” Normally it’s hard to use lots of different colors to differentiate items of interest, because there’s usually not an intuitive mapping between color and item (e.g. for countries, or states, or whatever). But the colors of crayons, what could be more perfect? So this graphic seemed awesome. But, as they discovered after some experimentation at  datapointed.net  there is an even BETTER possibility here. Click the link to see.

<p>Introduction: Now here’s a foundation I (Bob) can get behind: 
  

 Foundation for Open Access Statistics  (FOAS)

  
Their  mission  is to “promote free software, open access publishing, and reproducible research in statistics.”  To me, that’s like supporting  motherhood and apple pie !
 
FOAS spun out of and is partially designed to support the   Journal of Statistical Software   (aka  JSS , aka  JStatSoft ). I adore  JSS  because it (a) is open access, (b) publishes systems papers on statistical software, (c) has fast reviewing turnaround times, and (d) is free for authors and readers.  One of the next items on my to-do list is to write up the  Stan  modeling language and submit it to  JSS .
 
As a not-for-profit with no visible source of income, they are quite sensibly  asking for donations  (don’t complain — it beats $3K author fees or not being able to read papers).</p><p>5 0.84062302 <a title="832-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-08-For_chrissake%2C_just_make_up_an_analysis_already%21__We_have_a_lab_here_to_run%2C_y%E2%80%99know%3F.html">1973 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-08-For chrissake, just make up an analysis already!

<p>Introduction: Ben Hyde sends along  this :
  
Stuck in the middle of the supplemental data, reporting the total workup for their compounds, was this gem:

 
Emma, please insert NMR data here! where are they? and for this compound, just make up an elemental analysis . . .
 
  
I’m reminded of our recent  discussions  of coauthorship, where I argued that I see real advantages to having multiple people taking responsibility for the result.  Jay Verkuilen responded: “On the flipside of collaboration . . . is diffusion of responsibility, where everybody thinks someone else ‘has that problem’ and thus things don’t get solved.”  That’s what seems to have happened (hilariously) here.</p><p>6 0.8340736 <a title="832-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-15-BDA_class_4_G%2B_hangout_on_air_is_on_air.html">2101 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-15-BDA class 4 G+ hangout on air is on air</a></p>

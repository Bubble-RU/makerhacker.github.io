<p>Introduction: Andreas Graefe writes (see  here   here   here ):
  
The usual procedure for developing linear models to predict any kind of target variable is to identify a subset of most important predictors and to estimate weights that provide the best possible solution for a given sample. The resulting “optimally” weighted linear composite is then used when predicting new data. This approach is useful in situations with large and reliable datasets and few predictor variables. However, a large body of analytical and empirical evidence since the 1970s shows that the weighting of variables is of little, if any, value in situations with small and noisy datasets and a large number of predictor variables. In such situations, including all relevant variables is more important than their weighting. These findings have yet to impact many fields.

<p>Introduction: There is a lot of data on the web, meant to be looked at by people, but how do you turn it into a spreadsheet people could actually  analyze  statistically? 
 
The technique to turn web pages intended for people into structured data sets intended for computers is called “screen scraping.” It has just been made easier with a wiki/community  http://scraperwiki.com/ . 
 
They provide libraries to extract information from PDF, Excel files, to automatically fill in forms and similar. Moreover, the community aspect of it should allow researchers doing similar things to get connected. It’s very good. Here’s an example of scraping  road accident data  or  port of London ship arrivals .
 
You can already find collections of structured data online, examples are  Infochimps  (“find the world’s data”), and  Freebase  (“An entity graph of people, places and things, built by a community that loves open data.”).

<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
A little over three years ago I wrote a  post about exercise and weight loss  in which I described losing a fair amount of weight due to (I believe) an exercise regime, with no effort to change my diet; this contradicted the prediction of studies that had recently been released. The comment thread on that post is quite interesting: a lot of people had had similar experiences — losing weight, or keeping it off, with an exercise program that includes very short periods of exercise at maximal intensity — while other people expressed some skepticism about my claims. Some commenters said that I risked injury; others said it was too early to judge anything because my weight loss might not last.
 
The people who predicted injury were right: running the curve during a 200m sprint a month or two after that post, I strained my Achilles tendon. Nothing really serious, but it did keep me off the track for a couple of months, and rather than go back to sprinting I switched t</p><p>5 0.097213849 <a title="569-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-15-Exploratory_multilevel_analysis_when_group-level_variables_are_of_importance.html">1900 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-15-Exploratory multilevel analysis when group-level variables are of importance</a></p>

Much of what I do is cross-national analyses of survey data (largely World Values Survey). . . . My big question pertains to (what I would call) exploratory analysis of multilevel data, especially when the group-level predictors are of theoretical importance. A lot of what I do involves analyzing cross-national survey items of citizen attitudes, typically of political leadership. These survey items are usually yes/no responses, or four-part responses indicating a level of agreement (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) that can be condensed into a binary variable. I believe these can be explained by reference to country-level factors. Much of the group-level variables of interest are count variables with a modal value of 0, which can be quite messy.


How would you recommend exploring the variation in the dependent variable as it could be explained by the group-level count variable of interest, before fitting the multilevel model itself?

<p>Introduction: Guy asks:
  
I am analyzing an original survey of farmers in Uganda. I am hoping to use a battery of welfare proxy variables to create a single welfare index using PCA. I have quick question which I hope you can find time to address:


How do you recommend treating count data? (for example # of rooms, # of chickens, # of cows, # of radios)? In my dataset these variables are highly skewed with many responses at zero (which makes taking the natural log problematic). In the case of # of cows or chickens several obs have values in the hundreds.
  
My response:  Hereâ&euro;&trade;s what we do in our mi package in R.  We split a variable into two parts:  an indicator for whether it is positive, and the positive part.  That is, y = u*v.  Then u is binary and can be modeled using logisitc regression, and v can be modeled on the log scale.  At the end you can round to the nearest integer  if you want to avoid fractional values.</p><p>3 0.74406779 <a title="569-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-18-Check_your_missing-data_imputations_using_cross-validation.html">1218 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-18-Check your missing-data imputations using cross-validation</a></p>

I am currently using the iterative regression imputation model as implemented in the Stata ICE package. I am using data from a survey of about 90,000 students in 142 schools and my variable of interest is parent level of education. I want only this variable to be imputed with as little bias as possible as I am not using any other variable. So I scoured the survey for every variable I thought could possibly predict parent education. The main variable I found is parent occupation, which explains about 35% of the variance in parent education for the students with complete data on both. I then include the 20 other variables I found in the survey in a regression predicting parent education, which explains about 40% of the variance in parent education for students with complete data on all the variables.

I’m a media sociologist at the University of Houston.  I’ve been using HLM3 for about two years.  


Briefly about my data.  It’s a content analysis of news stories with a continuous scale dependent variable, story prominence.  I have 6090 news stories, 114 newspapers, and 59 newspaper group owners.  All the Level-1, Level-2 and dependent variables have been standardized. Since the means were zero anyway, we left the variables uncentered.  All the Level-3 ownership groups and characteristics are dichotomous scales that were left uncentered.  


PROBLEM:  The single most important result I am looking for is to compare the strength of nine competing Level-1 variables in their ability to predict and explain the outcome variable, story prominence.

I have questions regarding one technique you and your colleagues described in your papers: the cross validation (Multiple Imputation with Diagnostics (mi) in R: Opening Windows into the Black Box, with reference to Gelman, King, and Liu, 1998). I think this is the technique I need for my purpose, but I am not sure I understand it right. I want to use the multiple imputation to estimate the outcome of psychotherapies based on longitudinal data. First I have to demonstrate that I am able to get unbiased estimates with the multiple imputation. The expected bias is the overestimation of the outcome of dropouts.


I will test my imputation strategies by means of a series of simulations (delete values, impute, compare with the original). Due to the complexity of the statistical analyses I think I need at least 200 cases. Now I don’t have so many cases without any missings. My data have missing values in different variables.

My pipe dream is to create a taxonomy of variables and instances, and collect spreadsheets annotated this way. Imagine doing a search of type: “give me datasets, where an instance is a person, the variables are age, gender and weight” – and out would come datasets, each one tagged with the descriptions of the variables that were held constant for the whole dataset (person_type=student, location=Columbia, time_of_study=1/1/2009, study_type=longitudinal). It would even be possible to automatically convert one variable into another, if it was necessary (like age = time_of_measurement-time_of_birth). Maybe the dream of  Semantic Web  will actually be implemented for relatively structured statistical data rather than much fuzzier “knowledge”, just consider the difficulties of developing a universal  Freebase .

I am trying to do some studies on the  PageRank algorithm  with applying a Bayesian technique.  If you are not familiar with PageRank, it is the basis for how Google ranks their pages.  It basically treats the internet as a large social network with each link conferring some value onto the page it links to.  For example, if I had a webpage that had only one link to it, say from my friend’s webpage, then its PageRank would be dependent on my friend’s PageRank, presumably quite low.  However, if the one link to my page was off the Google search page, then my PageRank would be quite high since there are undoubtedly millions of pages linking to Google and few pages that Google links to.


The end result of the algorithm, however, is that all the PageRank values of the nodes in the network sum to one and the PageRank of a specific node is the probability that a “random surfer” will end up on that node.


For example, in the attached spreadsheet, Column D shows e</p><p>4 0.87696886 <a title="569-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-21-Workshop_for_Women_in_Machine_Learning.html">1992 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-21-Workshop for Women in Machine Learning</a></p>

WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION


The Workshop for Women in Machine Learning is a day-long event taking place on the first day of NIPS. 
The workshop aims to showcase the research of women in machine learning and to strengthen their community. 
The event brings together female faculty, graduate students, and research scientists for an opportunity to connect, exchange ideas, and learn from each other. Underrepresented minorities and undergraduates interested in pursuing machine learning research are encouraged to participate. While all presenters will be female, all genders are invited to attend.


Scholarships will be provided to female students and postdoctoral attendees with accepted abstracts to partially offset travel costs.

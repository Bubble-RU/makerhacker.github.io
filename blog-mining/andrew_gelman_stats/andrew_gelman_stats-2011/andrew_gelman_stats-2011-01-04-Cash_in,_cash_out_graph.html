Some of my coworkers at Facebook and I have worked with Udacity to create an online course on exploratory data analysis, including using data visualizations in R as part of EDA.


The course has now launched at  https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651  so anyone can take it for free. And Kaiser Fung has  reviewed it . So definitely feel free to promote it! Criticism is also welcome (we are still fine-tuning things and adding more notes throughout).

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.

A few months ago I heard about a study reporting that, during a recent eleven-year period, more babies were born on Valentine’s Day and fewer on Halloween compared to neighboring days:
 
   
 
I  wrote ,
  
What I’d really like to see is a graph with all 366 days of the year. It would be easy enough to make. That way we could put the Valentine’s and Halloween data in the context of other possible patterns. While they’re at it, they could also graph births by day of the week and show Thanksgiving, Easter, and other holidays that don’t have fixed dates. It’s so frustrating when people only show part of the story.

<p>Introduction: We haven’t had one of these in awhile, having mostly switched to the “chess trivia” and “bad p-values” genres of blogging . . .
 
But I had to come back to the topic after receiving this note from Raghuveer Parthasarathy:
  
 Here’s  another bad graph you might like.  It might (arguably) be even worse than the “worst graphs of the year” you’ve blogged about, since rather than being a poor representation of data, it is simply the plotting of a tautology that mistakenly gives the impression of being data.  (And it’s in Nature.)
  
 
 
Parthasarathy explains:
  
On the vertical axis we have the probability of being Type 2 Diabetic (T2D). On the horizontal axis we have the probability of being normal. There’s a clear, important trend evident, right? No! The probability of being normal is trivially one minus the probability of being T2D! The graph could not possibly be anything other than a straight line of slope -1.

<p>Introduction: I recently came across a data visualization that perfectly demonstrates the difference between the “infovis” and “statgraphics” perspectives.
 
 Here’s  the image ( link  from Tyler Cowen):
 
   
 
That’s the infovis. The statgraphic version would simply be a dotplot, something like this:
 
   
 
(I purposely used the default settings in R with only minor modifications here to demonstrate what happens if you just want to plot the data with minimal effort.)
 
Let’s compare the two graphs:
 
From a  statistical graphics  perspective, the second graph dominates.  The countries are directly comparable and the numbers are indicated by positions rather than area.  The first graph is full of distracting color and gives the misleading visual impression that the total GDP of countries 5-10 is about equal to that of countries 1-4.
 
If the goal is to  get attention , though, it’s another story.  There’s nothing special about the top graph above  except  how it looks.

To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.
 
The designers continue with these monstrosities:

Compared to my graph, Evan’s has better fonts, and that’s important–good fonts can make a display look professional.  But I’m not sure about his other innovations.  To me, the different colors for the different time-use categories are more of a distraction than a visual aid, and I also don’t like how he made the bars fatter.  As I noted in my earlier entry, to me this draws unwanted attention to the negative space between the bars.  His country labels are slightly misaligned (particularly Japan and USA), and I really don’t like his horizontal axis at all!  He removed the units of hours and put + and – on the edges so that the axes run into each other.  What was the point of that?  It’s bad news.

A few months ago I heard about a study reporting that, during a recent eleven-year period, more babies were born on Valentine’s Day and fewer on Halloween compared to neighboring days:

What I’d really like to see is a graph with all 366 days of the year. It would be easy enough to make. That way we could put the Valentine’s and Halloween data in the context of other possible patterns. While they’re at it, they could also graph births by day of the week and show Thanksgiving, Easter, and other holidays that don’t have fixed dates. It’s so frustrating when people only show part of the story.

I thought  this graph  [from Ed Easterling] might be good for your blog.


The 71 outlined squares show the main story, and the regions of the graph present the information nicely.


Looks like the bins for the color coding are not of equal size and of course the end bins are unbounded.  Might be interesting to graph the distribution of the actual data for the 71 outlined squares.   In addition, I assume that each period begins on Jan 1 so data size could be naturally increased by looking at intervals that start on June 1 as well (where the limit of this process would be to have it at the granularity of one day; while it most likely wouldn’t make much difference, I’ve seen some graphs before where 1 year returns can be quite sensitive to starting date, etc).
  
I agree that (a) the graph could be improved in small ways–in particular, adding half-year data seems like a great idea–and (b) it’s a wonderful, wonderful graph as is.

I came across your  paper  “Understanding Posterior Predictive P-values”, and I have a question regarding your statement “If a posterior predictive p-value is 0.4, say, that means that, if we believe the model, we think there is a 40% chance that tomorrow’s value of T(y_rep) will exceed today’s T(y).” This is perfectly understandable to me and represents the idea of calibration.  However, I am unsure how this relates to statements about fit.  If T is the LR chi-square or Pearson chi-square, then your statement that there is a 40% chance that tomorrows value exceeds today’s value indicates bad fit, I think.  Yet, some literature indicates that high p-values suggest good fit.  Could you clarify this?
  
My reply:
 
I think that “fit” depends on the question being asked.  In this case, I’d say the model fits for this particular purpose, even though it might not fit for other purposes.

<p>Introduction: Jimmy pointed me to  this  blog by Drew Conway on word clouds.  I don’t have much to say about Conway’s specifics–word clouds aren’t really my thing, but I’m glad that people are thinking about how to do them better–but I did notice one phrase of his that I’ll dispute.  Conway writes
  
The best data visualizations should stand on their own . . .
  
I disagree.  I prefer the saying, “A picture plus 1000 words is better than two pictures or 2000 words.”  That is, I see a positive interaction between words and pictures or, to put it another way, diminishing returns for words or pictures on their own.  I don’t have any big theory for this, but I think, when expressed as a joint value function, my idea makes sense.  Also, I live this suggestion in my own work.  I typically accompany my graphs with long captions and I try to accompany my words with pictures (although I’m not doing it here, because with the software I use, it’s much easier to type more words than to find, scale, and insert i</p><p>5 0.93307573 <a title="502-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-20-Adding_more_information_can_make_the_variance_go_up_%28depending_on_your_model%29.html">810 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-20-Adding more information can make the variance go up (depending on your model)</a></p>

Perhaps I am mistaken (thus this email), but it seems that this claim runs contra to the definition of conditional probability. That is, if you have a hierarchical model, and the family history / classical histopathology already suggests a parameter estimate with some variance, how could the new genomic info possibly increase the variance of that parameter estimate?

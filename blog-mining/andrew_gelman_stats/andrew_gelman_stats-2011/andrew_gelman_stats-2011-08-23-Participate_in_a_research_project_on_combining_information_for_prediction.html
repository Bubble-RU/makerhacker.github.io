I [Wallsten] am pleased to invite you to participate in an important research project to develop improved methods for predicting future events and outcomes. More specifically, our goal is to develop methods for aggregating many individual judgments in a manner that yields more accurate predictions than any one person or small group alone could provide. Our research is funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Project Activity (IARPA,  iarpa.gov ), but its application will extend far beyond intelligence to such areas as business forecasting or medical diagnosis. Our team consists of researchers at ARA, a private company; as well as researchers at the University of Maryland-College Park, University of Michigan, Ohio State University, Fordham University, University of California-Irvine, Wake Forest University, and the University of Missouri.

Postdoctoral Researcher (3 years) in State-Space Modeling of Animal Movement and Population Dynamics in Universities of Turku and Helsinki, Finland


We seek for a statistician/mathematician with experience in ecological modeling or an ecologist with strong quantitative training to join an interdisciplinary research team focusing on dispersal and dynamics of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans).


The Postdoctoral Researcher will develop modeling approaches (from individual based models to population level models) to assess the dispersal and population dynamics of the flying squirrel. A key challenge will be the integration of different kinds of data (census data, telemetry data, mark-recapture data, life-history data, and data on environmental covariates such as forest structure) into the modeling framework using Bayesian State-Space models or other such approaches.


The project will be supervised by Dr. Vesa Selonen (a flying squirrel specialist;</p><p>6 0.10931009 <a title="866-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-06-Josh_Tenenbaum_presents_._._._a_model_of_folk_physics%21.html">994 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-06-Josh Tenenbaum presents . . . a model of folk physics!</a></p>

It’s organized by Sharad Goel and Jake Hofman (Microsoft Research, formerly at Yahoo Research), David Park (Columbia University), and Sergei Vassilvitskii (Google).  As with our other conferences, one of our goals is to mix the academic and nonacademic research communities.
 
 Here’s the website  for the workshop, and here’s the announcement from the organizers: 
  
  
With an explosion of data on every aspect of our everyday existence — from what we buy, to where we travel, to who we know — we are able to observe human behavior with granularity largely thought impossible just a decade ago. The growth of such online activity has further facilitated the design of web-based experiments, enhancing both the scale and efficiency of traditional methods.

I saw your  recent blog post  where you discussed in passing an iterative-chain-of models approach to AI. 


I essentially built such a thing for  my PhD thesis  – not in a Bayesian context, but in a logic programming context – and proved it had a few properties and showed how you could solve some toy problems. The important bit of my framework was that at various points you also go and get more data in the process – in a statistical context this might be seen as building a little univariate model on a subset of the data, then iteratively extending into a better model with more data and more independent variables – a generalized forward stepwise regression if you like.  It wrapped a proper computational framework around E.M. Gold’s identification/learning in the limit based on a logic my advisor (Eric Martin) had invented.


What’s not written up in the thesis is a few months of failed struggle trying to shoehorn some simple statistical inference into this</p><p>2 0.98428905 <a title="866-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-29-%E2%80%9CCommunication_is_a_central_task_of_statistics%2C_and_ideally_a_state-of-the-art_data_analysis_can_have_state-of-the-art_displays_to_match%E2%80%9D.html">1552 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-29-“Communication is a central task of statistics, and ideally a state-of-the-art data analysis can have state-of-the-art displays to match”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Journal of the Royal Statistical Society publishes papers followed by discussions.  Lots of discussions, each can be no more than 400 words.  Here’s my most recent discussion:
  
The authors are working on an important applied problem and I have no reason to doubt that their approach is a step forward beyond diagnostic criteria based on point estimation.  An attempt at an accurate assessment of variation is important not just for statistical reasons but also because scientists have the duty to convey their uncertainty to the larger world.  I am thinking, for example, of discredited claims such as that of the mathematician who claimed to predict divorces with 93% accuracy (Abraham, 2010).


Regarding the paper at hand, I thought I would try an experiment in comment-writing.  My usual practice is to read the graphs and then go back and clarify any questions through the text.  So, very quickly:  I would prefer Figure 1 to be displayed in terms of standard deviations, not variances.

<p>Introduction: I just happened to notice this from last year.  Eric Loken  writes :
  
Steven Pinker reviewed Malcolm Gladwell’s latest book and criticized him rather harshly for several shortcomings. Gladwell appears to have made things worse for himself in a letter to the editor of the NYT by defending a manifestly weak claim from one of his essays – the claim that NFL quarterback performance is unrelated to the order they were drafted out of college. The reason w [Loken and his colleagues] are implicated is that Pinker identified an earlier blog post of ours as one of three sources he used to challenge Gladwell (yay us!). But Gladwell either misrepresented or misunderstood our post in his response, and admonishes Pinker by saying “we should agree that our differences owe less to what can be found in the scientific literature than they do to what can be found on Google.”


Well, here’s what you can find on Google.

<p>Introduction: I was given the opportunity to briefly comment on the  paper , A Bayesian approach to complex clinical diagnoses: a case-study in child abuse, by Nicky Best, Deborah Ashby, Frank Dunstan, David Foreman, and Neil McIntosh, for the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.  Here is what I wrote:

<p>Introduction: I received an email with the above title from Daniel Adkins, who elaborates:
  
I [Adkins] am having a tough time with a dataset including 40K obs and 8K subjects. Trying to estimate a 2 level logit with random intercept and age slope and about 13 fixed covariates. I have tried several R packages (lme4, lme4a, glmmPQL, MCMCglmm) and stata xtmelogit and gllamm to no avail. xtmelogit crashes from insufficient memory. The R packages yield false convergences. A simpler model w/ random intercept only gives stable estimates in lme4 with a very large number of quadrature point (nAGQ>220). When i try this (nAGQ=221) with the random age term, it doesn’t make it through a single iteration in 72 hours (have tried both w/ and w/out RE correlation). I am using a power desktop that is top of the line compared to anything other than a cluster. Have tried start values for fixed effects in lme4 and that doesn’t help (couldn’t figure out how to specify RE starts). Do you have any advice.

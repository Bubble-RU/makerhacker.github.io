What is legendary baseball statistician Bill James doing, defending the crime-coverups of legendary coach Joe Paterno?  As I wrote in my earlier blog on Paterno, it isn’t always easy to do the right thing, and I have no idea if I’d behave any better if I were in such a situation.  The characteristics of a good coach do not necessarily provide what it takes to make good decisions off the field.

<p>Introduction: Ben Lindbergh invited me to write an article for Baseball Prospectus.  I first sent him  this item  on the differences between baseball and politics but he said it was too political for them.  I then sent him  this review  of a book on baseball’s greatest fielders but he said they already had someone slotted to review that book.

Under what models is this a piece of evidence that the true effect is small?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Paul Pudaite writes in response to  my discussion with Bartels  regarding effect sizes and measurement error models:
  
You [Gelman] wrote: “I actually think there will be some (non-Gaussian) models for which, as y gets larger, E(x|y) can actually go back toward zero.”


I [Pudaite] encountered this phenomenon some time in the ’90s. See this graph which shows the conditional expectation of X given Z, when Z = X + Y and the probability density functions of X and Y are, respectively, exp(-x^2) and 1/(y^2+1) (times appropriate constants). As the magnitude of Z increases, E[X|Z] shrinks to zero.


 


I wasn’t sure it was worth the effort to try to publish a two paragraph paper.


I suspect that this is true whenever the tail of one distribution is ‘sufficiently heavy’ with respect to the tail of the other. Hmm, I suppose there might be enough substance in a paper that attempted to characterize this outcome for, say, unimodal symmetric distributions.
  
Maybe someone can do this? I think i</p><p>2 0.9742564 <a title="611-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-16-Bayesian_analogue_to_stepwise_regression%3F.html">1535 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-16-Bayesian analogue to stepwise regression?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes:
  
On pp. 250-251 of BDA second edition, you write about multiple comparisons, and you write about stepwise regression on p. 405.  How would you look at stepwise regression analyses in light of the multiple comparisons problem?  Is there an issue?
  
My reply:
 
In this case I think the right approach is to keep all the coefs but partially pool them toward 0 (after suitable transformation).  But then the challenge is coming up with a general way to construct good prior distributions.  Iâ&euro;&trade;m still thinking about that one!  Yet another approach is to put something together purely nonparametrically as with Bart.</p><p>3 0.96381485 <a title="611-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-07-A_compelling_reason_to_go_to_London%2C_Ontario%3F%3F.html">1104 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-07-A compelling reason to go to London, Ontario??</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Goldstein asks what I think of  this :
 
   
 
My reply:
 
It’s hard for me to imagine a compelling reason for anyone to go to London, Ontario–but, hey, I guess there’s all kinds of people in this world! More seriously, I see the appeal of the graph but it’s a bit busy for my taste.  Over the years I’ve moved toward small multiples rather than single busy graphs.  That’s one reason why I prefer Tufte’s second book to his first book.  The Napoleon-in-Russia graph is a bad model, in that inspires people to try to cram lots of variables on a single graph.

I [Dan] like it as a travel planning graph, it gives you what you want to know (how how will the days be, how cold will the nights be, will it rain) but is a bit easier on the brain than a table of highs and lows. Also makes it easy to see the trend.


I agree the 2nd axis doesn’t help.</p><p>4 0.95379996 <a title="611-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-30-What_Auteur_Theory_and_Freshwater_Economics_have_in_common.html">60 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-30-What Auteur Theory and Freshwater Economics have in common</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
 
We’ll define freshwater economics as the theory that economic behavior (and perhaps most non-economic behavior) can be explained using the concepts of rational actors and efficient markets and auteur theory as the idea that most films (particularly great films) represent the artistic vision of a single author (almost always the director) and the best way to approach one of those films is through the body of work of its author. Both of these definitions are oversimplified and a bit unfair but they will get the discussion started. . . .


Compared to their nearest neighbors, film criticism and economics (particularly macroeconomics) are both difficult, messy fields. Films are collaborative efforts where individual contributions defy attribution and creative decisions often can’t be distinguished from accidents of filming. Worse yet, most films are the product of large corporations which means that dozens of VPs and executives might have played a role (sometimes</p><p>5 0.94183481 <a title="611-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-25-Chris_Schmid_on_Evidence_Based_Medicine.html">1138 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-25-Chris Schmid on Evidence Based Medicine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Schmid is a statistician at New England Medical Center who is an expert on evidence-based medicine.  I invited him to present an introductory overview lecture on the topic at last year’s Joint Statistical Meetings, and  here are his slides .  All 123 of them.  I don’t know how he expected to go though all of these in an hour.  You could teach a semester-long course based on this material.

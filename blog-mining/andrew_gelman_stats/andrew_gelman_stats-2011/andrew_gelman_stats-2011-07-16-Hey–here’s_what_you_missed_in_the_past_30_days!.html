<p>Introduction: We all have opinions about the federal budget and how it should be spent. Infrequently, those opinions are informed by some knowledge about where the money actually goes.  It turns out that most people don’t have a clue.  What about you?  Here, take this poll/quiz and then compare your answers to (1) what other people said, in a CNN poll that asked about these same items and (2) compare your answers to the real answers.
 
Quiz is below the fold.
  

 
The questions below are from  a CNN poll.  
 
========
 
Think about all the money that the federal government spent last year. I’m going to name a few federal programs and for each one, I’d like you to estimate what percentage of the federal government’s budget last year was spent on each of those programs.
  
 Medicare — the federal health program for the elderly 
 Medicaid — the federal health program for the poor 
 Social Security 
 Military spending by the Department of Defense

<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who’d like to remain anonymous:
  
Lately I [the anonymous correspondent] witnessed that Bruno Frey has published two articles in two well known referreed journals on the Titanic disaster that try to explain survival rates of passenger on board.


The articles were published in the  Journal of Economic Perspectives  and  Rationality & Society .  While looking up the name of the second journal where I stumbled across the article I even saw that they put the message in a third journal, the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America .


To say it in Sopranos like style – with all due respect, I know Bruno Frey from conferences, I really appreciate his take on economics as a social science and he has really published  more interesting stuff that most economists ever will. But putting the same message into three journals gives me headaches for at least two reasons:

<p>Introduction: I’ve heard all sorts of scare stories of what it’s like to speak in an academic economics seminar:  they’re rude, they interrupt constantly, they don’t let you get through three slides in an hour, etc.  But whenever I’ve actually spoke in an economics department, the people have been polite and well-behaved, really it’s been like any other seminar. 
   
I mentioned this to some people awhile ago and they said that the nasty-economist thing only happens in the top departments.  I’d spoken at Columbia (which, if not at the very top, is still respectable), but that was in the political economy seminar and I’m a political scientist, so maybe they were nice to me because I’m local.  And the other econ departments where I’d spoken were in Europe (maybe they’re nicer there) or at non-elite institutions in the U.S.  So I called my friend at Harvard econ, told him my story, and asked if I could speak there.  He duly booked me for the Harvard-MIT econometrics seminar.
 
I  spoke  at the seminar,</p><p>3 0.71797562 <a title="805-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-05-Racism%21.html">321 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-05-Racism!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last night I spoke at the Columbia Club of New York, along with some of my political science colleagues, in a  panel  about politics, the economy, and the forthcoming election.  The discussion was fine . . . until one guy in the audience accused us of bias based on what he imputed as our ethnicity.  One of the panelists replied by asking the questioner what of all the things we had said was biased, and the questioner couldn’t actually supply any examples.
 
It makes sense that the questioner couldn’t come up with a single example of bias on our part, considering that we were actually presenting  facts .
 
At some level, the questioner’s imputation of our ethnicity and accusation of bias isn’t so horrible.  When talking with my friends, I engage in casual ethnic stereotyping all the time–hey, it’s a free country!–and one can certainly make the  statistical  argument that you can guess people’s ethnicities from their names, appearance, and speech patterns, and in turn you can infer a lot</p><p>4 0.70241892 <a title="805-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-05-Shocking_but_not_surprising.html">698 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-05-Shocking but not surprising</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Much-honored playwright Tony Kushner was set to receive one more honor–a degree from John Jay College–but it was suddenly  taken away  from him on an 11-1 vote of the trustees  of the City University of New York.  This was the first rejection of an honorary degree nomination since 1961.
 
The news article focuses on one trustee, Jeffrey Wiesenfeld, an investment adviser and onetime political aide, who opposed Kushner’s honorary degree, but to me the relevant point is that the committee as a whole voted 11-1 to ding him.
 
Kusnher said, “I’m sickened,” he added, “that this is happening in New York City. Shocked, really.”  I can see why he’s shocked, but perhaps it’s not so surprising that it’s happening in NYC.  Recall the famous incident from 1940 in which Bertrand Russell was invited and then uninvited to teach at City College.  The problem that time was Russell’s views on free love (as they called it back then).  There seems to be a long tradition of city college officials being will</p><p>5 0.69483858 <a title="805-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-15-Some_decision_analysis_problems_are_pretty_easy%2C_no%3F.html">1417 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-15-Some decision analysis problems are pretty easy, no?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  reports :
  
A 47-year-old woman in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, got behind the wheel of her car after having a bit too much to drink, but instead of wreaking havoc on the road, she ended up lodged in a sand trap at a local golf course. Why? Because her GPS made her do it—obviously! She said the GPS told her to turn left, and she did, right into a cornfield. That didn’t faze her, and she just kept on going until she ended up on the golf course and got stuck in the sand. There were people on the course at the time, but thankfully nobody was injured. Police found a cup full of alcohol in her car and arrested her for driving drunk.
  
Here’s the punchline:
  
This is the fourth time she’s been arrested for a DUI.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  hypothesizes  a “dogmatism portfolio” or a “quota of dogmatism”:  in his words,
  
If you’re very dogmatic in one area, you may be less dogmatic in others.
  
OK, well “may be” is pretty vague.  There’s not really anything to disagree with, yet.  But then Cowen continues:
  
 
There’s a lesson here.  If you wish to be a more open-minded thinker, adhere to some extreme and perhaps unreasonable fandoms, the more firmly believed the better and the more obscure the area the better.  This will help fulfill your dogmatism quota, yet without much skewing your more important beliefs.
 

 
He seems to be making a testable prediction here, that levels of dogmatism on two randomly chosen issues should be negatively correlated.  I guess I should call this “almost testable,” as it still requires an issue-by-issue measure of dogmatism.  (Is it dogmatic to believe that there was this guy called Jesus who walked on water . . . or is it dogmatic to say that Jesus  didn’t  walk on water and</p><p>same-blog 2 0.94553596 <a title="805-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-16-Hey%E2%80%93here%E2%80%99s_what_you_missed_in_the_past_30_days%21.html">805 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-16-Hey–here’s what you missed in the past 30 days!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK, the  30 days of statistics  are over.  I’ll still be posting regularly on statistical topics, but now it will be mixed in with everything else, as before.
 
Here’s what I put on the sister blogs in the past month:
 
1.  How to write  an entire report  with fake data.
 
2.  “Life getting shorter for women in hundreds of U.S. counties”:  I’d  like to see  a graph of relative change in death rates, with age on the x-axis.
 
3.   “Not a choice” != “genetic” .
 
4.  Remember when I said I’d never again post on albedo?  I was  lying .
 
5.  Update on Arrow’s theorem.  It’s  a Swiss thing , you wouldn’t understand.
 
6.  Dan Ariely can’t read, but  don’t blame  Johnson and Goldstein.
 
7.  My co-blogger endorses college scholarships for  bowling .  Which reminds me that my friends and I did “intramural bowling” in high school to get out of going to gym class.  Nobody paid us.  We even had to rent the shoes!
 
8.

<p>Introduction: This article  by Thomas Crag, at Copenhagenize, is marred by reliance on old data, but it’s so full of informative graphical displays — most of them not made by the author, I think — that it’s hard to pick just one.  But here ya go. This figure shows fatalities (among cyclists) versus distance cycled, with a point for each year…unfortunately ending in way back in 1998, but still: 
   This is a good alternative to the more common choice for this sort of plot, which would be overlaying curves of fatalities vs time and distance cycled vs time.  
 
The article also explicitly discusses the fact,  previously discussed on this blog , that it’s misleading, to the point of being wrong in most contexts, to compare the safety of walking vs cycling vs driving by looking at the casualty or fatality rate  per kilometer .  Often, as in this article, the question of interest is something like, if more people switched from driving to cycling, how many more or fewer people would die?  Obviously, if peo</p><p>4 0.92675626 <a title="805-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-21-Red_state_blue_state%2C_or%2C_states_and_counties_are_not_persons.html">1587 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-21-Red state blue state, or, states and counties are not persons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to  this  news article by Lauren Sandler:
  
Stunningly, the postponement of marriage and parenting — the factors that shrink the birth rate — is the very best predictor of a person’s politics in the United States, over even income and education levels, a Belgian demographer named Ron Lesthaeghe [and coauthor Lisa Neidert]  has discovered . Larger family size in America correlates to early marriage and childbirth, lower women’s employment, and opposition to gay rights — all social factors that lead voters to see red.
  
All the analysis in the linked paper is at the state and county level.  That’s fine but this is not going to tell you what is a “predictor of a person’s politics.”  Cowen labels his post “Sentences to ponder,” and what I want to ponder is that people are so quick to jump from aggregate to individual patterns.
 
And, yes, I know that aggregate patterns are related to individual patterns but they’re not the same.   In particular, from the evidence we’</p><p>5 0.92579615 <a title="805-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-27-Continued_fractions%21%21.html">1827 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-27-Continued fractions!!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Upon reading  this note  by John Cook on continued fractions, I wrote:
  
If you like continued fractions, I recommend you read the relevant parts of the classic Numerical Methods That Work. The details are probably obsolete but it’s fun reading (at least, if you think that sort of thing is fun to read).
  
I then looked up Acton in Wikipedia and was surprised to see he’s still alive. And he wrote a second book (published at the age of 77!). I wonder if it’s any good. It’s sobering to read Numerical Methods That Work: it’s so wonderful and so readable, yet in this modern era there’s really not much reason to read it. Perhaps William Goldman (hey, I checked: he’s still alive too!) or some equivalent could prepare a 50-page “good parts” version that could be still be useful as a basic textbook.</p><p>6 0.91988826 <a title="805-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-26-What_Do_We_Learn_from_Narrow_Randomized_Studies%3F.html">732 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-26-What Do We Learn from Narrow Randomized Studies?</a></p>

</p><p>4 And it’s displacing a lot of better content, by destroying the business model for quality. [sent-19, score-0.266]
</p><p>5 I do, however, understand Rauch’s frustration:  after painstakingly establishing a reputation writing books and working for newspapers and magazines, he’s reduced to posting on Andrew Sullivan’s blog. [sent-35, score-0.229]
</p><p>6 So few people read most academic articles that I’m  thrilled  to have 5000 readers for my musings. [sent-48, score-0.196]
</p><p>7 Rauch is coming from the opposite direction, writing for newspapers and magazines where hundreds of thousands of people are exposed to every word in print. [sent-49, score-0.288]
</p><p>8 Feelings of frustration    Rauch writes that journalists like himself are “the kind of people who punched their tickets on newspaper police beats where they learned quaint notions of fairness and accuracy and keeping one’s opinions out of it and all that. [sent-51, score-0.549]
</p><p>9 So I can feel his frustration that bloggers today feel free to express their opinions in public–just like Rauch, but they never had to do all that police-beat stuff first. [sent-53, score-0.447]
</p><p>10 Academic publishing    Rauch writes that blogging, and the internet in general, is “displacing a lot of better content, by destroying the business model for quality. [sent-64, score-0.273]
</p><p>11 The argument that paid writing is better than free writing just doesn’t apply in my world. [sent-70, score-0.399]

</p><p>14 In many ways I like the result, but I agree with Rauch’s (implicit) statement that a blog is not so friendly to the reader who is used to reading magazine articles that are structured, Gladwell-style, around personal anecdotes. [sent-84, score-0.246]

</p><p>16 Conversely, if like Rauch you’ve trained yourself to write in that professional style, it must be frustrating to suddenly enter a world in which people can get wide internet readership without ever having developed that skill. [sent-87, score-0.285]
</p><p>17 I’m blogging cos I want to, Rauch is blogging even though he’d rather be doing something else. [sent-97, score-0.306]

</p><p>19 Summary    Take away the rhetoric and the personal stories, and we’re left with Rauch’s central claim, which is that blogging is “destroying the business model for quality. [sent-102, score-0.251]

<p>Introduction: I was thinking a bit more about  Jonathan Rauch’s lament  about the fading of  the buggy-whip industry  print journalism, in which he mocks bloggers, analogizes blogging to scribbling with spray paint on the side of a building, and writes that the blogosphere is “the single worst medium for sustained, and therefore grown-up, reading and writing and argumentation ever invented.”
 
Yup.  Worse than talk radio.  Worse than cave painting.  Worse than smoke signals, rock ‘n’ roll lyrics, woodcuts, spray-paint graffiti, and every other medium of communication ever invented.
 
OK, he didn’t really mean it.  Rauch actually has an ironclad argument here.  He’s claiming, in a blog, that blogging is crap.  Therefore, if he fills his blog with unsupported exaggerations, that’s fine, as he’s demonstrating that blogging is . . . crap.

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi  writes :
  
I suspect that within a decade, blogs will be a cornerstone of research in economics. Many original and creative contributions to the discipline will first be communicated to the profession (and the world at large) in the form of blog posts, since the medium allows for material of arbitrary length, depth and complexity. Ideas first expressed in this form will make their way (with suitable attribution) into reading lists, doctoral dissertations and more conventionally refereed academic publications. And blogs will come to play a central role in the process of recruitment, promotion and reward at major research universities. This genie is not going back into its bottle.
  
And he thinks this is a good thing:
  
In fact, the refereeing process for blog posts is in some respects more rigorous than that for journal articles. Reports are numerous, non-anonymous, public, rapidly and efficiently produced, and collaboratively constructed. It is not obvious to me [Sethi]</p><p>4 0.13646027 <a title="865-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-10-28-Writing_for_free.html">2080 andrew gelman stats-2013-10-28-Writing for free</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Max Read  points  to discussions by  Cord Jefferson  and  Tim Krieger  about people who write for free, thus depressing the wages of paid journalists.
 
The topic interests me because I’m one of those people who writes for free, all the time.
 
As a commenter  wrote  in response to Cord Jefferson’s article:
  
It’s not just people who have inherited money, it’s also people who have “day jobs” to support themselves while they pursue dream jobs in fields like journalism, fiction writing, theater and music.
  
In this case, I’m pursuing the dream job of blogging, but it’s the same basic idea.
 
I actually enjoy doing this, which is more than can be said of Tim Kreider, who writes:
  
I will freely admit that writing beats baling hay or going door-to-door for a living, but it’s still shockingly unenjoyable work.
  
I’m lucky enough not to ever have had to bale hay or go door-to-door for a living, but I find writing to be enjoyable!

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi  quotes  Bentley University economics professor Scott Sumner  writing  on the first anniversary of his blog:
  
Be careful what you wish for.  Last February 2nd I [Sumner] started this blog with very low expectations… I knew I wasn’t a good writer . . . And I was also pretty sure that the content was not of much interest to anyone.


Now my biggest problem is time–I spend 6 to 10 hours a day on the blog, seven days a week.  Several hours are spent responding to reader comments and the rest is spent writing long-winded posts and checking other economics blogs. . . .


I [Sumner] don’t think much of the official methodology in macroeconomics.  Many of my fellow economists seem to have a Popperian view of the social sciences.  You develop a model.  You go out and get some data.  And then you try to refute the model with some sort of regression analysis. . . .


My problem with this view is that it doesn’t reflect the way macro and finance actually work.  Instead the models are</p><p>6 0.11591692 <a title="865-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-02-Fragment_of_statistical_autobiography.html">390 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-02-Fragment of statistical autobiography</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Zoe Corbyn’s article for  The Guardian  (UK), titled  Wikipedia wants more contributions from academics , and the followup  discussion on Slashdot  got me thinking about my own Wikipedia edits.  
 
The article quotes Dario Taraborelli, a research analyst for the Wikimedia Foundation, as saying “Academics are trapped in this paradox of using Wikipedia but not contributing,”  Huh?  I’m really wondering what man-in-the-street wrote all the great stats stuff out there.  And what’s the paradox?  I use lots of things without contributing to them.  
 
Taraborelli is further quoted as saying “The Wikimedia Foundation is looking at how it might capture expert conversation about Wikipedia content happening on other websites and feed it back to the community as a way of providing pointers for improvement.”

<p>Introduction: Even within the realm of writing-about-statistics, there are things I can say in a blog that are much more difficult to include in an academic article.  Blogging gives me freedom.
 
But I want to distinguish between two different sorts of frankness.
 
1.  Obnoxiousness:  In a blog I can write, “I hate X” as rudely as I’d like without needing to justify myself.
 
2.  Openness:  In a blog I can write about the limitations of my work.  It’s a real challenge to discuss limitations in a scholarly article, as we’re always looking over our shoulder at what referees might think.  Sure, sometimes I can get away with  writing  “Survey weighting is a mess,” but my impression is that most scholarly articles are relentlessly upbeat.  Sort of like how a magazine article typically will have a theme and just plug it over and over.  In a blog we can more easily admit uncertainty.
 
Overall, I think blogs are more celebrated for feature 1 above (the freedom to say what you  really  feel, to be rude, par</p><p>6 0.85782439 <a title="865-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-24-Blogging.html">49 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-24-Blogging</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sharad  explains :
  
HIV/AIDS, like many other contagious diseases, exemplifies the common view of so-called viral propagation, growing from a few initial cases to millions through close person-to-person interactions. (Ironically, not all viruses in fact exhibit “viral” transmission patterns. For example, Hepatitis A often spreads through contaminated drinking water.[1]) By analogy to such biological epidemics, the diffusion of products and ideas is conventionally assumed to occur “virally” as well, as evidenced by prevailing theoretical frameworks (e.g., the cascade and threshold models) and an obsession in the marketing world for all things social. . . .


Despite hundreds of papers written about diffusion, there is surprisingly little work addressing this fundamental empirical question.


In a recent study, Duncan Watts, Dan Goldstein, and I [Goel] examined the adoption patterns of several different types of products diffusing over various online platforms — including Twitter, Face</p><p>2 0.96705621 <a title="865-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-03-NYC_Data_Skeptics_Meetup.html">1837 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-03-NYC Data Skeptics Meetup</a></p>

The hype surrounding Big Data and Data Science is at a fever pitch with promises to solve the worldâ&euro;&trade;s business and social problems, large and small. How accurate or misleading is this message? How is it helping or damaging people, and which people? What opportunities exist for data nerds and entrepreneurs that examine the larger issues with a skeptical view?


 This Meetup  focuses on mathematical, ethical, and business aspects of data from a skeptical perspective. Guest speakers will discuss the misuse of and best practices with data, common mistakes people make with data and ways to avoid them, how to deal with intentional gaming and politics surrounding mathematical modeling, and taking into account the feedback loops and wider consequences of modeling. We will take deep dives into models in the fields of Data Science, statistics, financial engineering, and economics.

<p>Introduction: Alex Braunstein  writes  about Klout, a company which measures Twitter/Facebook influence:
  
As a Ph D statistician and search quality engineer, I [Braunstein] know a lot about how to properly measure things. In the past few months I’ve become an active Twitter user and very interested in measuring the influence of individuals. Klout provides a way to measure influence on Twitter using a score also called Klout. The range is 0 to 100. Light users score below 20, regular users around 30, and celebrities start around 75. Naturally, I was intrigued by the Klout measurement, but a careful analysis led to some serious issues with the score. . . .
  
Braunstein continues with some comparisons of different twitter-users and how their Klout scores don’t make much sense.  I don’t really see the point of the Klout scores in the first place:  I guess they’re supposed to be a quick measure to use in pricing advertising?  Whatever, I don’t really care.

<p>Introduction: Under the heading, “Why Preschool Shouldn’t Be Like School,” cognitive psychologist Alison Gopnik  describes  research showing that four-year-olds learn better if they’re encouraged to discover and show to others, rather than if they’re taught what to do.  This makes sense, but it’s not clear to me why this wouldn’t apply to older kids and adults.  It’s a commonplace in teaching at all levels that students learn by doing and by demonstrating what they can do.  Even when a student is doing nothing but improvising from a template, we generally believe the student will learn better by explaining what’s going on, by having a mental model of the process to go along with the proverbial 10,000 hours or practice.  The challenge is in the implementation, how to get students interested, motivated, and focused enough to put the effort into learning.
 
So why the headline above?  Why does Gopnik’s research support the idea that preschool should be different from school?

<p>Introduction: Journalist Jonathan Rauch  writes  that the internet is Sturgeon squared:
  
This is the blogosphere. I’m not getting paid to be here. I’m here to get incredibly famous (in my case, even more incredibly famous) so that I can get paid somewhere else. . . .


The average quality of newspapers and (published) novels is far, far better than the average quality of blog posts (and–ugh!–comments). This is because people pay for newspapers and novels. What distinguishes newspapers and novels is how much does not get published in them, because people won’t pay for it. Payment is a filter, and a pretty good one. Imperfect, of course. But pointing out the defects of the old model is merely changing the subject if the new model is worse. . . .


Yes, the new model is bringing a lot of new content into being. But most of it is bad. And it’s displacing a lot of better content, by destroying the business model for quality. Even in the information economy, there’s no free lunch. . . .

<p>Introduction: Ellen Barnes writes, in response to  my paper and the associated discussion at JCGS ,

<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>3 0.13373826 <a title="736-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-10-Using_a_%E2%80%9Cpure_infographic%E2%80%9D_to_explore_differences_between_information_visualization_and_statistical_graphics.html">847 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-10-Using a “pure infographic” to explore differences between information visualization and statistical graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our discussion on data visualization continues.
 
One one side are three statisticians–Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, and myself.  We have been writing about the different goals served by information visualization and statistical graphics.
 
On the other side are graphics experts (sorry for the imprecision, I don’t know exactly what these people do in their day jobs or how they are trained, and I don’t want to mislabel them) such as  Robert Kosara  and  Jen Lowe , who seem a bit annoyed at how my colleagues and myself seem to follow the Tufte strategy of criticizing what we don’t understand.
 
And on the third side are many (most?) academic statisticians, econometricians, etc., who don’t understand or respect graphs and seem to think of visualization as a toy that is unrelated to serious science or statistics.
 
I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>4 0.13173099 <a title="736-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-27-A_use_for_tables_%28really%29.html">372 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-27-A use for tables (really)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After our  recent discussion  of semigraphic displays, Jay Ulfelder sent along a semigraphic table from his recent book.  He notes, “When countries are the units of analysis, it’s nice that you can use three-letter codes, so all the proper names have the same visual weight.”
 
Ultimately I think that graphs win over tables for display.  However in our work we spend a  lot of time looking at raw data, often simply to understand what data we have.  This use of tables has, I think, been forgotten in the statistical graphics literature.
 
So I’d like to refocus the eternal tables vs. graphs discussion.  If the goal is to present information, comparisons, relationships, models, data, etc etc, graphs win.  Forget about tables.
 
But . . . when you’re looking at your data, it can often help to see the raw numbers.  Once you’re looking at numbers, it makes sense to organize them.  Even a displayed matrix in R is a form of table, after all.  And once you’re making a table, it can be sensible to</p><p>5 0.12553781 <a title="736-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Infovis%2C_infographics%2C_and_data_visualization%3A__Where_I%E2%80%99m_coming_from%2C_and_where_I%E2%80%99d_like_to_go.html">878 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Infovis, infographics, and data visualization:  Where I’m coming from, and where I’d like to go</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.

<p>Introduction: Alberto Cairo  tells a fascinating story  about John Snow, H. W. Acland, and the Mythmaking Problem:
  
Every human community—nations, ethnic and cultural groups, professional guilds—inevitably raises a few of its members to the status of heroes and weaves myths around them. . . . The visual display of information is no stranger to heroes and myth. In fact, being a set of disciplines with a relatively small amount of practitioners and researchers, it has generated a staggering number of heroes, perhaps as a morale-enhancing mechanism. Most of us have heard of the  wonders  of William Playfair’s Commercial and Political Atlas, Florence Nightingale’s coxcomb charts, Charles Joseph Minard’s Napoleon’s march diagram, and Henry Beck’s 1933 redesign of the London Underground map. . . .
  
Cairo’s goal, I think, is not to disparage these great pioneers of graphics but rather to put their work in perspective, recognizing the work of their excellent contemporaries.

10. Wegman 
9. Hipmunk 
8. Dennis the dentist 
7. Freakonomics 
6. The difference between significant and non-significant is not itself statistically significant 
5. Just use a hierarchical model already! 
4. Innumerate journalists who think that presidential elections are just like high school 
3. A graph can be pretty but convey essentially no information

<p>Introduction: This  blog  by J. Robert Lennon on abandoned novels made me think of the more general topic of abandoned projects.  I seem to recall George V. Higgins writing that he’d written and discarded 14 novels or so before publishing The Friends of Eddie Coyle.
 
I haven’t abandoned any novels but I’ve abandoned lots of research projects (and also have started various projects that there’s no way I’ll finish).  If you think about the decisions involved, it really has to be that way. You learn while you’re working on a project whether it’s worth continuing.  Sometimes I’ve put in the hard work and pushed a project to completion, published the article, and then I think . . . what was the point?  The modal number of citations of our articles is zero, etc.</p><p>3 0.94527185 <a title="736-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-27-Confusion_from_illusory_precision.html">1186 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-27-Confusion from illusory precision</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I posted this  link  to Dean Foster’s rants, some commenters pointed out  this  linked claim by famed statistician/provacateur Bjorn Lomberg:
  
If [writes Lomborg] you reduce your child’s intake of fruits and vegetables by just 0.03 grams a day (that’s the equivalent of half a grain of rice) when you opt for more expensive organic produce, the total risk of cancer goes up, not down. Omit buying just one apple every 20 years because you have gone organic, and your child is worse off.
  
Let’s unpack Lomborg’s claim.  I don’t know anything about the science of pesticides and cancer, but can he really be so sure that the effects are so small as to be comparable to the health effects of eating “just one apple every 20 years”?
 
I can’t believe you could estimate effects to anything like that precision.  I can’t believe anyone has such a precise estimate of the health effects of pesticides, and also I can’t believe anyone has such a precise effect of the health effect of eating an app</p><p>same-blog 4 0.93740463 <a title="736-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-29-Response_to_%E2%80%9CWhy_Tables_Are_Really_Much_Better_Than_Graphs%E2%80%9D.html">736 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-29-Response to “Why Tables Are Really Much Better Than Graphs”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ellen Barnes writes, in response to  my paper and the associated discussion at JCGS ,
  
I [Barnes] am an industry statistician.  I will agree that a table of numbers is essential in an academic publication.  The readers want to be able to sit down with the numbers, and make sure they can replicate the results.  However, graphics communicate faster – especially when a group of engineers are trying to figure out what is going on.  Or, there are times when I have just a couple minutes to convey a complex relationship to a director or a vice-president.


One example from this week:  We are putting a new subsystem into some of our vehicles – using new technology.  The technical specialist leading the project wanted to double check to make sure the system was working properly and finalize the calibration procedure.  He mentioned a concern that was nagging him.  I plotted his data in a matrix plot (a matrix of two dimensional scatter plots).  We immediately keyed in on one plot that showed s</p><p>5 0.92886138 <a title="736-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-06-Stan_1.2.0_and_RStan_1.2.0.html">1753 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-06-Stan 1.2.0 and RStan 1.2.0</a></p>

Here are the highlights.
  Full Mass Matrix Estimation during Warmup  
Yuanjun Gao, a first-year grad student here at Columbia (!), built a regularized mass-matrix estimator.   This helps for posteriors with high correlation among parameters and varying scales.  We’re still testing this ourselves, so the estimation procedure may change in the future (don’t worry — it satisfies detailed balance as is, but we might be able to make it more computationally efficient in terms of time per effective sample).
 
It’s not the default option.  The major reason is the matrix operations required are expensive, raising the algorithm cost to    , where   is the average number of leapfrog steps,   is the number of iterations, and   is the number of parameters.
 
Yuanjun did a great job with the Cholesky factorizations and implemented this about as efficiently as is possible.

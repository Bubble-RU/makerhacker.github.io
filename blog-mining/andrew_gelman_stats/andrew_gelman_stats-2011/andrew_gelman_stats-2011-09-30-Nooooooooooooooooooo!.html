<p>Introduction: The other day we had a fun little discussion in  the comments section of the sister blog  about the appropriateness of stating forecast probabilities to the nearest tenth of a percentage point.
 
It started when Josh Tucker posted this graph from  Nate Silver :
 
   
 
My first reaction was:  this looks pretty but it’s hyper-precise.  I’m a big fan of Nate’s work, but all those little wiggles on the graph can’t really mean anything.  And what could it possibly mean to compute this probability to that level of precision?
 
In the comments, people came at me from two directions.  From one side, Jeffrey Friedman  expressed  a hard core attitude that it’s meaningless to give a probability forecast of a unique event:
  
What could it possibly mean, period, given that this election will never be repeated? . . .

<p>Introduction: Someone who wants to remain anonymous writes:
  
I am working to create a more accurate in-game win probability model for basketball games. My idea is for each timestep in a game (a second, 5 seconds, etc), use the Vegas line, the current score differential, who has the ball, and the number of possessions played already (to account for differences in pace) to create a point estimate probability of the home team winning.


This problem would seem to fit a multi-level model structure well. It seems silly to estimate 2,000 regressions (one for each timestep), but the coefficients should vary at each timestep. Do you have suggestions for what type of model this could/would be? Additionally, I believe this needs to be some form of logit/probit given the binary dependent variable (win or loss).


Finally, do you have suggestions for what package could accomplish this in Stata or R?
  
To answer the questions in reverse order:

<p>Introduction: I recently  wrote  about the difficulty people have with probabilities, in this case the probability that Obama wins the election. If the probability is reported as 70%, people think Obama is going to win.  Actually, though, it just means that Obama is predicted to get about 50.8% of the two-party vote, with an uncertainty of something like 2 percentage points.  So, as I wrote, the election really is too close to call in the sense that the predicted vote margin is less than its uncertainty.
 
But . . . when people see a number such as 70%, they tend to attribute too much certainty to it.  Especially when the estimated probability has increased from, say 60%.  How to get the point across?  Commenter HS  had  what seems like a good suggestion:
  
Say that Obama will win, but there is 25% chance (or whatever) that this prediction is wrong? Same point, just slightly different framing, but somehow, this seems far less incendiary.
  
I like that.  Somehow a stated probability of 75% sounds a</p><p>5 0.13426098 <a title="934-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-12-How_to_Lie_With_Statistics_example_number_12%2C498%2C122.html">1574 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-12-How to Lie With Statistics example number 12,498,122</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
Bill Kristol notes that “Four presidents in the last century have won more than 51 percent of the vote twice: Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Reagan and Obama”. I’m not sure why Kristol, a conservative, is promoting the idea that Obama has a mandate, but that’s up to him. I’m more interested in the remarkable bit of cherry-picking that led to this “only four presidents” statistic.
 
There was one way in which Obama’s victory was large: he won the electoral college 332-206. That’s a thrashing. But if you want to claim that Obama has a “popular mandate” — which people seem to interpret as an overwhelming preference of The People such that the opposition is morally obligated to give way — you can’t make that argument based on the electoral college, you have to look at the popular vote. That presents you with a challenge for the 2012 election, since Obama’s 2.7-point margin in the popular vote was the 12th-smallest out of the 57 elections we’ve had. There’s a  nice sor</p><p>6 0.12886949 <a title="934-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-25-Note_to_student_journalists%3A__Google_is_your_friend.html">1027 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-25-Note to student journalists:  Google is your friend</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hibbs, one of the original economy-and-elections guys,  writes :
  
The number of House seats won by the presidents party at midterm elections is well explained by three pre-determined or exogenous variables: (1) the number of House seats won by the in-party at the previous on-year election, (2) the vote margin of the in-partys candidate at the previous presidential election, and (3) the average growth rate of per capita real disposable personal income during the congressional term. Given the partisan division of House seats following the 2008 on-year election, President Obamas margin of victory in 2008, and the weak growth of per capita real income during the rst 6 quarters of the 111th Congress, the Democrats chances of holding on to a House majority by winning at least 218 seats at the 2010 midterm election will depend on real income growth in the 3rd quarter of 2010.

<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan and Jacob Montgomery talk sense  here .  I am perhaps too influenced by Steven Rosenstoneâ&euro;&trade;s 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections, which is the first thing I read on the topic.  In any case, I agree with Nyhan and Montgomery that the difference in vote, comparing a centrist candidate to an extreme candidate, is probably on the order of 1-2%, not the 4% that has been posited by some.
 
Among other things, ideological differences between candidates of the same party might seem big in the primaries, but then when the general election comes along, party ID becomes more important.
 
I also disagree with the model in which presidential elections are like votes for high school  prom king .</p><p>5 0.78870571 <a title="934-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-07-A_question_about_voting_systems%E2%80%94unrelated_to_U.S._elections%21.html">1566 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-07-A question about voting systems—unrelated to U.S. elections!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jan Vecer writes about a new voting system that is now being considered in the Czech Republic which faces a political crisis where some elected officials became corrupted: 
  
  
I came across a new suggestion about a voting system. The proposal is that in each electoral district the voter chooses 2 candidates (plus vote), but also chooses one candidate with a minus vote. Two top candidates with the highest vote count (= number of plus votes – number of minus votes) are elected to a parliament. There are 81 districts in total, the parliament would have 162 members if the proposal goes through. The intention of the negative vote is to eliminate controversial candidates. 


Are there any clear advantages over the classical “select one candidate” system? Or disadvantages?
  
Any thoughts on this?  I am not an expert on this topic but maybe some of you are.</p><p>6 0.7762934 <a title="934-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-25-Note_to_student_journalists%3A__Google_is_your_friend.html">1027 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-25-Note to student journalists:  Google is your friend</a></p>

<p>Introduction: These  (from Shaun Usher) are surprisingly good, especially since he appears to come up with new lists and letters pretty regularly.  I suppose a lot of them get sent in from readers, but still.
 
Here’s my favorite recent item, a  letter  sent to the Seattle Bureau of Prohibition in 1931:
  
Dear Sir:


My husband is in the habit of buying a quart of wiskey every other day from a Chinese bootlegger named Chin Waugh living at 317-16th near Alder street.


We need this money for household expenses. Will you please have his place raided? He keeps a supply planted in the garden and a smaller quantity under the back steps for quick delivery. If you make the raid at 9:30 any morning you will be sure to get the goods and Chin also as he leaves the house at 10 o’clock and may clean up before he goes.


Thanking you in advance, 


I remain 
yours truly,


Mrs. Hillyer</p><p>2 0.94404638 <a title="934-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-21-If_a_lottery_is_encouraging_addictive_gambling%2C_don%E2%80%99t_expand_it%21.html">1731 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-21-If a lottery is encouraging addictive gambling, don’t expand it!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  story from Vivian Yee seems just horrible to me.  First the background:
  
Pronto Lotto’s real business takes place in the carpeted, hushed area where its most devoted customers watch video screens from a scattering of tall silver tables, hour after hour, day after day.


The players — mostly men, about a dozen at any given time — come on their lunch breaks or after work to study the screens, which are programmed with the Quick Draw lottery game, and flash a new set of winning numbers every four minutes. They have helped make Pronto Lotto the top Quick Draw vendor in the state, selling $3.3 million worth of tickets last year, more than $1 million more than the second busiest location, a World Books shop in Penn Station.


Some stay for just a few minutes. Others play for the length of a workday, repeatedly traversing the few yards between their seats and the cash register as they hand the next wager to a clerk with a dollar bill or two, and return to wait.

<p>Introduction: Paul Nee sends in  this  amusing item:
  
 
MELA Sciences claimed success in a clinical trial of its experimental skin cancer detection device only by altering the statistical method used to analyze the data in violation of an agreement with U.S. regulators, charges an independent healthcare analyst in a report issued last week. . . The BER report, however, relies on its own analysis to suggest that MELA struck out with FDA because the agency’s medical device reviewers discovered the MELAFind pivotal study failed to reach statistical significance despite the company’s claims to the contrary.
 

 
And now here’s where it gets interesting:
  
MELA claims that a phase III study of MELAFind met its primary endpoint by detecting accurately 112 of 114 eligible melanomas for a “sensitivity” rate of 98%. The lower confidence bound of the sensitivity analysis was 95.1%, which met the FDA’s standard for statistical significance in the study spelled out in a binding agreement with MELA, the compa</p><p>4 0.92479092 <a title="934-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-07-There_are_never_70_distinct_parameters.html">327 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-07-There are never 70 distinct parameters</a></p>

I’m a graduate student in computational biology, and I’m relatively new to advanced statistics, and am trying to teach myself how best to approach a problem I have.


My dataset is a small sparse matrix of 150 cases and 70 predictors, it is sparse as in many zeros, not many ‘NA’s.  Each case is a nutrient that is fed into an in silico organism, and its response is whether or not it stimulates growth, and each predictor is one of 70 different pathways that the nutrient may or may not belong to.  Because all of the nutrients do not belong to all of the pathways, there are thus many zeros in my matrix.  My goal is to be able to use the pathways themselves to predict whether or not a nutrient could stimulate growth, thus I wanted to compute regression coefficients for each pathway, with which I could apply to other nutrients for other species.


There are quite a few singularities in the dataset (summary(glm) reports that 14 coefficients are not defined because of sin</p><p>same-blog 5 0.91168159 <a title="934-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-30-Nooooooooooooooooooo%21.html">934 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-30-Nooooooooooooooooooo!</a></p>

Quantitative historian Allan Lichtman claims to have discovered 13 predictors that determine who will win the popular vote in presidential elections. He predicts Obama will win in 2012. Writing in his New York Times column, “538,” Nate Silver attempted a critique Lichtman’s prediction. Soon afterward Lichtman wrote a rejoinder. Evidently Lichtman has correctly and publicly predicted the popular vote winners in the last 7 presidential elections. I think he predicted Gore would win in 2000. He got the popular vote winner right, but not electoral college vote winner. Lichtman presents his methods in his early 1980s book, “The Keys to the White House.” Lichtman consulted with Volodia Keilis-Borok, and used a kernel discriminant analysis approach on election results from 1860-1980 as the training set. I think there is some argument as to scoring because Lichtman claims more than 7 successes. I guess he divided the data into a training and validation sets and w</p><p>6 0.90381145 <a title="934-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-22-Going_Beyond_the_Book%3A_Towards_Critical_Reading_in_Statistics_Teaching.html">1023 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-22-Going Beyond the Book: Towards Critical Reading in Statistics Teaching</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Aki and I  write :
  
The Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) and cross-validation are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model. WAIC is based on the series expansion of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO), and asymptotically they are equal. With finite data, WAIC and cross-validation address different predictive questions and thus it is useful to be able to compute both. WAIC and an importance-sampling approximated LOO can be estimated directly using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. We show how to compute WAIC, IS-LOO, K-fold cross-validation, and related diagnostic quantities in the Bayesian inference package Stan as called from R.
  
This is important, I think.  One reason the deviance information criterion (DIC) has been so popular is its implementation in Bugs.  We think WAIC and cross-validation make more sense than DIC, especially from a Bayesian perspective in whic</p><p>5 0.16323702 <a title="776-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-15-More_on_AIC%2C_WAIC%2C_etc.html">1983 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-15-More on AIC, WAIC, etc</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following up on our  discussion  from the other day, Angelika van der Linde sends along  this paper  from 2012 (link to journal  here ).
 
And Aki pulls out this great quote from Geisser and Eddy (1979):
  
This discussion makes clear that in the nested case this method, as Akaike’s, is not consistent; i.e., even if $M_k$ is true, it will be rejected with probability $\alpha$ as $N\to\infty$. This point is also made by Schwarz (1978).  However, from the point of view of prediction, this is of no great consequence. For large numbers of observations, a prediction based on the falsely assumed $M_k$, will not differ appreciably from one based on the true $M_k$.  For example, if we assert that two normal populations have different means when in fact they have the same mean, then the use of the group mean as opposed to the grand mean for predicting a future observation results in predictors which are asymptotically equivalent and whose predictive variances are $\sigma^2[1 + (1/2n)]$ and $\si</p><p>6 0.14710924 <a title="776-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-02-A_important_new_survey_of_Bayesian_predictive_methods_for_model_assessment%2C_selection_and_comparison.html">1648 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-02-A important new survey of Bayesian predictive methods for model assessment, selection and comparison</a></p>

We develop a general methodology for the probabilistic integration of differential equations via model based updating of a joint prior measure on the space of functions and their temporal and spatial derivatives. This results in a posterior measure over functions reflecting how well they satisfy the system of differential equations and corresponding initial and boundary values. We show how this posterior measure can be naturally incorporated within the Kennedy and O’Hagan framework for uncertainty quantification and provides a fully Bayesian approach to model calibration. . . . A broad variety of examples are provided to illustrate the potential of this framework for characterising discretization uncertainty, including initial value, delay, and boundary value differential equations, as well as partial differential equations.

<p>Introduction: Aki Vehtari and Janne Ojanen just published a  long paper  that begins:
  
To date, several methods exist in the statistical literature for model assessment, which purport themselves specifically as Bayesian predictive methods. The decision theoretic assumptions on which these methods are based are not always clearly stated in the original articles, however. The aim of this survey is to provide a unified review of Bayesian predictive model assessment and selection methods, and of methods closely related to them. We review the various assumptions that are made in this context and discuss the connections between different approaches, with an emphasis on how each method approximates the expected utility of using a Bayesian model for the purpose of predicting future data.
  
AIC (which Akaike called “An Information Criterion”) is the starting point for all these methods.  More recently, Watanabe came up with WAIC (which he called the “Widely Available Information Criterion”).

<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend of mine who is an untenured professor (not in statistics or political science) was telling me about a class where many of the students seemed to be resubmitting papers that they had already written for previous classes.  (The supposition was based on internal evidence of the topics of the submitted papers.)  It would be possible to check this and then kick the cheating students out of the program—but why do it?  It would be a lot of work, also some of the students who are caught might complain, then word would get around that my friend is a troublemaker.  And nobody likes a troublemaker.
 
Once my friend has tenure it would be possible to do the right thing.  But . . . here’s the hitch:  most college instructors do  not  have tenure, and one result, I suspect, is a decline in ethical standards.
 
This is something I hadn’t thought of in our  earlier discussion  of job security for teachers:  tenure gives you the freedom to kick out cheating students.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.95272535 <a title="776-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-22-Deviance%2C_DIC%2C_AIC%2C_cross-validation%2C_etc.html">776 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-22-Deviance, DIC, AIC, cross-validation, etc</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The deviance information criterion (or DIC) is an idea of Brad Carlin and others for comparing the fits of models estimated using Bayesian simulation (for more information, see  this article  by Angelika van der Linde).
 
I don’t really ever know what to make of DIC.  On one hand, it seems sensible, it handles uncertainty in inferences within each model, and it does not depend on aspects of the models that don’t affect inferences within each model (unlike Bayes factors; see discussion  here ).  On the other hand, I don’t really have any idea what I would do with DIC in any real example.  In our book we included an example of DIC–people use it and we don’t have any great alternatives–but I had to be pretty careful that the example made sense.  Unlike the usual setting where we use a method and that gives us insight into a problem, here we used our insight into the problem to make sure that in this particular case the method gave a reasonable answer.

<p>Introduction: We’re all familiar with the gee-whiz style of science and technology writing in which hardly a day dawns without a cure for cancer, or a new pollution-free energy source, or some other amazing breakthrough.
 
We don’t always get the privilege of seeing such reporting shot down the moment it hits the presses.
 
Here’s journalist Matthew Philips:
  
What does it take for an idea to spread from one to many? For a minority opinion to become the majority belief? According to a new study by scientists at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the answer is 10%. Once 10% of a population is committed to an idea, it’s inevitable that it will eventually become the prevailing opinion of the entire group. The key is to remain committed. . . . The research actually validates the entrenched strategy of the handful of House Republicans threatening to sink John Boehner‘s budget proposal. Turns out if you’re in the minority, you have less of an incentive to compromise than the majority does.

<p>Introduction: Daniel Mendelsohn recently  asked , “Why do we love the Titanic?”, seeking to understand how it has happened that: 
  
  
It may not be true that ‘the three most written-about subjects of all time are Jesus, the Civil War, and the Titanic,’ as one historian has put it, but it’s not much of an exaggeration. . . . The inexhaustible interest suggests that the Titanic’s story taps a vein much deeper than the morbid fascination that has attached to other disasters. The explosion of the Hindenburg, for instance, and even the torpedoing, just three years after the Titanic sank, of the Lusitania, another great liner whose passenger list boasted the rich and the famous, were calamities that shocked the world but have failed to generate an obsessive preoccupation. . . . 


If the Titanic has gripped our imagination so forcefully for the past century, it must be because of something bigger than any fact of social or political or cultural history.

<p>Introduction: Jessy, Aki, and I  write :
  
We review the Akaike, deviance, and Watanabe-Akaike information criteria from a Bayesian perspective, where the goal is to estimate expected out-of-sample-prediction error using a bias-corrected adjustment of within-sample error. We focus on the choices involved in setting up these measures, and we compare them in three simple examples, one theoretical and two applied. The contribution of this review is to put all these information criteria into a Bayesian predictive context and to better understand, through small examples, how these methods can apply in practice.
  
I like this paper.  It came about as a result of preparing Chapter 7 for the  new BDA .  I had difficulty understanding AIC, DIC, WAIC, etc., but I recognized that these methods served a need.  My first plan was to just apply DIC and WAIC on a couple of simple examples (a linear regression and the 8 schools) and leave it at that.  But when I did the calculations, I couldnâ&euro;&trade;t understand the resu</p><p>6 0.94324017 <a title="776-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-26-WAIC_and_cross-validation_in_Stan%21.html">2349 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-26-WAIC and cross-validation in Stan!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Knowing of my interest in  Turing run-around-the-house chess , David Lockhart points me to  this :
  
Diving Chess is a chess variant, which is played in a swimming pool. Instead of using chess clocks, each player must submerge themselves underwater during their turn, only to resurface when they are ready to make a move. Players must make a move within 5 seconds of resurfacing (they will receive a warning if not, and three warnings will result in a forfeit). Diving Chess was invented by American Chess Master Etan Ilfeld; the very first exhibition game took place between Ilfeld and former British Chess Champion William Hartston at the Thirdspace gym in Soho on August 2nd, 2011. Hartston won the match which lasted almost two hours such that each player was underwater for an entire hour.</p><p>4 0.14956515 <a title="982-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-19-What_makes_a_statistician_look_like_a_hero%3F.html">2031 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-19-What makes a statistician look like a hero?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  writes :
  
Chess derives most of its complexity through differentiated pieces; with checkers the complexity comes from the interaction between pieces. The result is a series of elegant graph problems where the viable paths change with each move of your opponent. To draw an analogy with chess, imagine if moving your knight could allow your opponent’s bishop to move like a rook. Add to that the potential for traps and manipulation that come with forced capture and you have one of the most remarkable games of all time. . . .


It’s not unusual to hear masters of both chess and checkers (draughts) to admit that they prefer the latter. So why does chess get all the respect? Why do you never see a criminal mastermind or a Bond villain playing in a checkers tournament?


Part of the problem is that we learn the game as children so we tend to think of it as a children’s game. We focus on how simple the rules are and miss how much complexity and subtlety you can get out of those ru</p><p>6 0.13209312 <a title="982-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-28-Turing_chess_run_update.html">1473 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-28-Turing chess run update</a></p>

Here’s a sample:
  
As soon as I [Kaiser] put the substring-concatenate expression together with two lines of code that generate data tables, it choked.

Kaiser writes:
  
What makes the designer want to tilt the reader’s head?


This chart is unreadable. It also fails the self-sufficiency test. All 13 data points are printed onto the chart. You really don’t need the axis, and the gridlines.


A further design flaw is the use of signposts. Our eyes are drawn to the hexagons containing the brand icons but the data is at the other end of the signpost, where it is planted on the surface!


Here is a sketch of something not as cute:


 


I [Kaiser] expressed time as years . . . The mobile-related entities are labelled red. The dots could be replaced by the hexagonal brand icons.
  
I agree with all of Kaiser’s criticisms, and I agree that his graph is, from the statistical perspective, a zillion times better than what was published. On the other hand, unusual images can get attention. Recall the famous/notorious clock plot from  Florence Nightingale .

<p>Introduction: Kaiser  nails it .  The offending  article , by John Tierney, somehow ended up in the Science section rather than the Opinion section.  As an opinion piece (or, for that matter, a blog), Tierney’s article would be nothing special.  But I agree with Kaiser that it doesn’t work as a newspaper article.  As Kaiser notes, this story involves a bunch of statistical and empirical claims that are not well resolved by P.R. and rhetoric.</p><p>5 0.69048035 <a title="982-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-09-%E2%80%9C%E2%80%98Why_work%3F%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D.html">461 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-09-“‘Why work?’”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links to  a “scary comparison” that claims that “a one-parent family of three making $14,500 a year (minimum wage) has more disposable income than a family making $60,000 a year.”
 
Kaiser Fung  looks into this comparison  in more detail.  As Kaiser puts it:
  
 
If we concede that the middle-income person would end up with less disposable income than the lower-income person, then we’d expect that the middle-income people will take lower-paying jobs so as to increase their disposable income. But I have not seen reports of such reverse social mobility. Theory needs to fit reality. This hole in the theory needs to be covered.
 

 
This argument sounds convincing at first, but I’m not completely sure it’s right.  I’d just like to expand on one of Kaiser’s other points, which is that people don’t usually have a choice between a minimum-wage job and a $60,000 job.  Also, my impression is that higher-paying jobs are more pleasant than lower-paying jobs.

<p>Introduction: Kaiser Fung  points  to the above self-canceling statement which comes from a quantitatively-trained  expert  on international debt.  I can only assume that he was speaking quickly and that the reporter didn’t know enough to ask him to clarify.  When I’m interviewed, I emit a lot of ums, uhs, and probably quite a few meaningless remarks, but usually whoever is interviewing me knows to just keep the good stuff.  As Kaiser points out, the above quote could mean two completely opposite things!  In context I’m sure it was clear to the speaker but it’s not at all obvious what’s going on in the published version.  Again, I’m not blaming the expert here, it’s just a miscommunication that got into the article, something that Kaiser noticed (and that I care about) because of our interest in probability communication.
 
In any case, the line “at least as much as an 80 percent chance” should join “ But viewed in retrospect, it is clear that it has been quite predictable ” in the Probability Hall</p><p>2 0.87910235 <a title="982-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-13-Convincing_Evidence.html">1979 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-13-Convincing Evidence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Keith O’Rourke and I wrote  an article  that begins:
  
Textbooks on statistics emphasize care and precision, via concepts such as reliability and validity in measurement, random sampling and treatment assignment in data collection, and causal identification and bias in estimation. But how do researchers decide what to believe and what to trust when choosing which statistical methods to use? How do they decide the credibility of methods? Statisticians and statistical practitioners seem to rely on a sense of anecdotal evidence based on personal experience and on the attitudes of trusted colleagues. Authorship, reputation, and past experience are thus central to decisions about statistical procedures.
  
It’s for a volume on theoretical or methodological research on authorship, functional roles, reputation, and credibility in social media, edited by Sorin Matei and Elisa Bertino.</p><p>3 0.87685001 <a title="982-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-18-Those_mean_psychologists%2C_making_fun_of_dodgy_research%21.html">1329 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-18-Those mean psychologists, making fun of dodgy research!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Two people separately sent me  this amusing mock-research paper  by Brian A. Nosek (I assume that’s what’s meant by “Arina K. Bones”).  The article is pretty funny, but  this poster  (by Nosek and Samuel Gosling) is even better!  Check it out:
 
   
 
   
 
I remarked that this was almost as good as my zombies paper, and my correspondent pointed me to  this page  of (I assume) Nosek’s research on aliens.
 
P.S.  I clicked through to take  the test  to see if I’m dead or alive, but I got bored after a few minutes.  I gotta say, if Gosling can  come up with  a 10-item measure of the Big Five, this crew should be able to come up with a reasonably valid alive-or-dead test that doesn’t require dozens and dozens of questions!</p><p>4 0.86155713 <a title="982-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-10-The_recursion_of_pop-econ.html">1850 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-10-The recursion of pop-econ</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dave Berri  posted  the following at the Freakonomics blog:
  
The “best” picture of 2012 was Argo. At least that’s the film that won the Oscar for best picture.  According to the Oscars, the decision to give this award to Argo was made by the nearly 6,000 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. . . . In other words, this choice is made by the “experts.”  There is, though, another group that we could have listened to on Sunday night.  That group would be the people who actually spend money to go to the movies. . . . According to that group, Marvel’s the Avengers was the “best” picture in 2012. With domestic revenues in excess of $600 million, this filmed earned nearly $200 million more than any other picture. And when we look at world-wide revenues, this film brought in more than $1.5 billion. . . . Despite what seems like a clear endorsement by the customers of this industry, the Avengers was ignored by the Oscars.  Perhaps this is just because I am an econo</p><p>5 0.85474896 <a title="982-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-14-Causal_inference_in_economics.html">32 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-14-Causal inference in economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aaron Edlin points me to  this  issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives that focuses on statistical methods for causal inference in economics.  (Michael Bishop’s page provides  some links .)
 
To quickly summarize my reactions to Angrist and Pischke’s book:  I pretty much agree with them that the potential-outcomes or natural-experiment approach is the most useful way to think about causality in economics and related fields.  My main amendments to Angrist and Pischke would be to recognize that:
 
1.  Modeling is important, especially  modeling of interactions .  It’s unfortunate to see a debate between experimentalists and modelers.  Some experimenters (not Angrist and Pischke) make the mistake of avoiding models:  Once they have their experimental data, they check their brains at the door and do nothing but simple differences, not realizing how much more can be learned.  Conversely, some modelers are unduly dismissive of experiments and formal observational studies, forgetting t</p><p>6 0.85455114 <a title="982-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-06-Lee_Nguyen_Tran_Kim_Song_Shimazaki.html">1657 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-06-Lee Nguyen Tran Kim Song Shimazaki</a></p>

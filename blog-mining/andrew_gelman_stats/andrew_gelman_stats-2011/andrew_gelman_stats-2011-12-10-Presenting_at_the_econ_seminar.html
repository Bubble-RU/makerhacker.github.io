<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I delivered a 10-minute talk on statistical graphics that went so well, it was the best-received talk I’ve ever given.  The crowd was raucous.  Then some poor sap had to go on after me.  He started by saying that my talk was a hard act to follow.  And, indeed, the audience politely listened but did not really get involved in his presentation.  Boy did I feel smug.
 
More recently I gave a talk on Stan, at an entirely different venue.  And this time the story was the exact opposite.  Jim Demmel spoke first and gave a wonderful talk on optimization for linear algebra (it was an applied math conference).  Then I followed, and I never really grabbed the crowd.  My talk was not a disaster but it didn’t really work.  This was particularly frustrating because I’m really excited about Stan and this was a group of researchers I wouldn’t usually have a chance to reach.  It was the plenary session at the conference.
 
Anyway, now I know how that guy felt from last month.

<p>Introduction: It  went pretty well, especially considering it was an  entirely new talk  (even though, paradoxically, all the images were old), and even though I had a tough act to follow:  I came on immediately after an excellent short presentation by Jed Dougherty on some cool information and visualization software that he and his colleagues are building for social workers.
 
The only problems with my were:
 
(a) I planned to elicit more audience involvement but didn’t do it. It would’ve been easy:  at any point I could’ve just paused and had the audience members work in pairs to come up with suggested improvements to any of my graphs.  But I forgot to do it.
 
(b) I went on too long.  The talk was going so well, I didn’t stop.  In retrospect, it would’ve been better to stop earlier.  Better for people to leave the table hungry than stuffed.
 
Also, next time I’ll drop the bit about the nuns-in-prison movies.  People weren’t getting the connection to the point I was making about presetting the sig</p><p>3 0.81278151 <a title="1050-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-30-I_just_skyped_in_from_Kentucky%2C_and_boy_are_my_arms_tired.html">438 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-30-I just skyped in from Kentucky, and boy are my arms tired</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just gave my first Skype presentation today, and it felt pretty strange.
 
The technical difficulties mostly arose with the sound.  There were heavy echoes and so we ended up just cutting off the sound from the audience.  This made it more difficult for me because I couldn’t gauge audience reaction.  It was a real challenge to give a talk without being able to hear the laughter of the audience.  (I asked them to wave their hands every time they laughed, but they didn’t do so–or else they were never laughing, which would be even worse.)
 
Next time I’ll use the telephone for at least one of the sound channels.
 
The visuals were ok from my side–I just went thru my slides one by one, using the cursor to point to things.  I prefer standing next to the screen and pointing with my hands.  But doing it this way was ok, considering.
 
The real visual problem went the other way:  I couldn’t really see the audience.  From the perspective of the little computer camera, everyone seemed far away</p><p>4 0.80798632 <a title="1050-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-30-A_graphics_talk_with_no_visuals%21.html">1598 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-30-A graphics talk with no visuals!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: So, I’m at MIT, twenty minutes into my  talk  on tradeoffs in information graphics to the computer scientists, when the power goes out.  They had some dim backup lighting so we weren’t all sitting there in the dark, but the projector wasn’t working.  So I took questions for the remaining 40 minutes.  It went well, perhaps better than the actual talk would’ve gone, even though they didn’t get to see most of my  slides .</p><p>5 0.80247247 <a title="1050-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-29-G%2B_%3E_Skype.html">1143 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-29-G+ > Skype</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I  spoke  at the University of Kansas the other day.  Kansas is far away so I gave the talk by video.  We did it using a G+ hangout, and it worked really well, much much better than when I gave a talk via  Skype .  With G+, I could see and hear the audience clearly, and they could hear me just fine while seeing my slides (or my face, I went back and forth).  Not as good as a live presentation but pretty good, considering.
 
P.S.  And  hereâ&euro;&trade;s  how to do it!

<p>Introduction: Stephanie Evergreen writes:
  
 
Media, web design, and marketing have all created an environment where stakeholders – clients, program participants, funders – all expect high quality graphics and reporting that effectively conveys the valuable insights from evaluation work. Some in statistics and mathematics have used data visualization strategies to support more useful reporting of complex ideas. Global growing interest in improving communications has begun to take root in the evaluation field as well. But as anyone who has sat through a day’s worth of a conference or had to endure a dissertation-worthy evaluation report knows, evaluators still have a long way to go. To support the development of researchers and evaluators, some members of the American Evaluation Association are proposing a new TIG (Topical Interest Group) on Data Visualization and Reporting.  If you are a member of AEA (or want to be) and you are interested in joining this TIG,  contact  Stephanie Evergreen.</p><p>2 0.91060859 <a title="1050-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-13-Data_sharing_update.html">1055 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-13-Data sharing update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fred Oswald reports that Sian Beilock sent him sufficient amounts of raw data from  her research study  so allow him to answer his questions about the large effects that were observed.  This sort of collegiality is central to the collective scientific enterprise.
 
The bad news is that IRB’s are still getting in the way.  Beilock was very helpful but she had to work within the constraints of her IRB, which apparently advised her not to share data—even if de-identified—without getting lots more permissions.

It is a little concerning that the IRB bars the sharing of de-identified data, particularly in light of the  specific guidelines  of the journal Science, which appears to say that when you submit a study to the journal for publication, you are allowing for the sharing of de-identified data — unless you expressly say otherwise at the point that you submit the paper for consideration.

<p>Introduction: Adam Marcus at Retraction Watch  reports  on a physicist at the University of Toronto who had this unfortunate thing happen to him:
  
This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and first and corresponding author.


The article was largely a duplication of a paper that had already appeared in ACS Nano, 4 (2010) 3374–3380, http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn100335g.


The first and the corresponding authors (Kramer and Sargent) would like to apologize for this administrative error on their part . . .
  
“Administrative error” . . . I love that!  Is that what the robber says when he knocks over a liquor store and gets caught?  As Marcus points out, the two papers have different titles and a different order of authors, which makes it less plausible that this was an administrative mistake (as could happen, for example, if a secretary was given a list of journals to submit the paper to, and accidentally submitted it to the second journal on the list without realizing it</p><p>4 0.89397871 <a title="1050-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-%E2%80%9CRewarding_Strivers%3A__Helping_Low-Income_Students_Succeed_in_College%E2%80%9D.html">95 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-“Rewarding Strivers:  Helping Low-Income Students Succeed in College”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several years ago, I heard about a project at the Educational Testing Service to  identify “strivers”:  students from disadvantaged backgrounds who did unexpectedly well on the SAT (the college admissions exam formerly known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” but apparently now just “the SAT,” in the same way that Exxon is just “Exxon” and that Harry Truman’s middle name is just “S”), at least 200 points above a predicted score based on demographic and neighborhood information.  My ETS colleague and I agreed that this was a silly idea:  From a statistical point of view, if student A is expected ahead of time to do better than student B, and then they get identical test scores, then you’d expect student A (the non-”striver”) to do better than student B (the “striver”) later on.  Just basic statistics:  if a student does much better than expected, then probably some of that improvement is noise.  The idea of identifying these “strivers” seemed misguided and not the best use of the SAT.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.88366514 <a title="1050-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-10-Presenting_at_the_econ_seminar.html">1050 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-10-Presenting at the econ seminar</a></p>

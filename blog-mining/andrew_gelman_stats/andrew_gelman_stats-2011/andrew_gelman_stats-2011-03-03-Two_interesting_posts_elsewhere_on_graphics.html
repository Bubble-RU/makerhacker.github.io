<p>Introduction: Our discussion on data visualization continues.
 
One one side are three statisticians–Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, and myself.  We have been writing about the different goals served by information visualization and statistical graphics.
 
On the other side are graphics experts (sorry for the imprecision, I don’t know exactly what these people do in their day jobs or how they are trained, and I don’t want to mislabel them) such as  Robert Kosara  and  Jen Lowe , who seem a bit annoyed at how my colleagues and myself seem to follow the Tufte strategy of criticizing what we don’t understand.
 
And on the third side are many (most?) academic statisticians, econometricians, etc., who don’t understand or respect graphs and seem to think of visualization as a toy that is unrelated to serious science or statistics.
 
I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>3 0.15762143 <a title="599-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-09-The_quest_for_the_holy_graph.html">794 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-09-The quest for the holy graph</a></p>

I was just going through the latest draft of  your paper with Anthony Unwin . I heard part of it at  the talk  you gave (remotely) here at UMich.  I’m curious about your discussion of the  Baby Name Voyager .


The tool in itself is simple, attractive, and useful.  No argument from me there.  It’s an awesome demonstration of how subtle interactions can be very helpful (click and it zooms, type and it filters… falls perfectly into the Shneiderman visualization mantra). It satisfies a very common use case: finding appropriate names for children.


That said, I can’t help but feeling that what you are really excited about is  the very static analysis on last letters  (you spend most of your time on this).  This analysis, incidentally, is not possible to infer from the interactive application (which doesn’t support this type of filtering and pivoting).  In a sense, the two visualizations don’t have anything to do with each other (other than a shared context/dataset).</p><p>4 0.14423229 <a title="599-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-19-Tradeoffs_in_information_graphics.html">1584 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-19-Tradeoffs in information graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The visual display of quantitative information (to use Edward Tufte’s wonderful term) is a diverse field or set of fields, and its practitioners have different goals. The goals of software designers, applied statisticians, biologists, graphic designers, and journalists (to list just a few of the important creators of data graphics) often overlap—but not completely. One of our aims in writing  our article  [on Infovis and Statistical Graphics] was to emphasize the diversity of graphical goals, as it seems to us that even experts tend to consider one aspect of a graph and not others.


Our main practical suggestion was that, in the internet age, we should not have to choose between attractive graphs and informational graphs: it should be possible to display both, via interactive displays. But to follow this suggestion, one must first accept that not every beautiful graph is informative, and not every informative graph is beautiful. . . .

<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.
 
(c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are</p><p>6 0.12494337 <a title="599-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-22-%E2%80%9CInformation_visualization%E2%80%9D_vs._%E2%80%9CStatistical_graphics%E2%80%9D.html">816 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-22-“Information visualization” vs. “Statistical graphics”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: By now you all must be tired of my one-sided presentations of the differences between infovis and statgraphics (for example,  this article  with Antony Unwin).
 
Today is something different.  Courtesy of Martin Theus, editor of the Statistical Computing and Graphics Newsletter, we have two short articles offering competing perspectives:
 
Robert Kosara writes from an Infovis view:
  
Information visualization is a field that has had trouble defining its boundaries, and that consequently is often misunderstood. It doesn’t help that InfoVis, as it is also known, produces pretty pictures that people like to look at and link to or send around. But InfoVis is more than pretty pictures, and it is more than statistical graphics.


The key to understanding InfoVis is to ignore the images for a moment and focus on the part that is often lost: interaction. When we use visualization tools, we don’t just create one image or one kind of visualization. In fact, most people would argue that there is</p><p>4 0.73512524 <a title="599-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-04-An_epithet_I_can_live_with.html">1604 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-04-An epithet I can live with</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here . Indeed, I’d much rather be a legend than a myth.
 
I just want to clarify one thing.  Walter Hickey writes:
  
[Antony Unwin and Andrew Gelman] collaborated on this presentation where they take a hard look at what’s wrong with the recent trends of data visualization and infographics.


The takeaway is that while there have been great leaps in visualization technology, some of the visualizations that have garnered the highest praises have actually been lacking in a number of key areas.


Specifically, the pair does a takedown of the top visualizations of 2008 as decided by the popular statistics blog Flowing Data.
  
This is a fair summary, but I want to emphasize that, although our dislike of some award-winning visualizations is central to our argument, it is only the first part of our story.

The first addresses  familiar   subjects  to readers of the blog, with some nice examples of where infographics emphasize the obvious, or increase the probability of an incorrect insight.

<p>Introduction: Causality and Statistical Learning 
 
Andrew Gelman, Statistics and Political Science, Columbia University
 
Wed 27 Mar, 4pm, Betty Ford Auditorium, Ford School of Public Policy
 
Causal inference is central to the social and biomedical sciences.  There are unresolved debates about the meaning of causality and the methods that should be used to measure it.  As a statistician, I am trained to say that randomized experiments are a gold standard, yet I have spent almost all my applied career analyzing observational data.  In this talk we shall consider various approaches to causal reasoning from the perspective of an applied statistician who recognizes the importance of causal identification yet must learn from available information.
 
Two relevant papers are  here  and  here .</p><p>3 0.89414996 <a title="599-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-30-History_is_too_important_to_be_left_to_the_history_professors%2C_Part_2.html">2192 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-30-History is too important to be left to the history professors, Part 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Completely non-gay historian Niall Ferguson, a man who  we can be sure  would never be caught at a ballet or a poetry reading,  informs us  that the British decision to enter the first world war on the side of France and Belgium was “the biggest error in modern history.”
 
Ummm, here are a few bigger errors: 
   
The German decision to invade Russia in 1941.
 
The Japanese decision to attack America in 1941.
 
 Oh yeah , the German decision to invade Belgium in 1914.
 
The Russian decision to invade Afghanistan in 1981 doesn’t look like such a great decision either.
 
And it wasn’t so smart for Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait, but maybe the countries involved were too small for this to count as “the biggest error in modern history.”
 
It’s striking that, in considering the biggest error in modern history, Ferguson omits all these notorious acts of aggression (bombing Pearl Harbor, leading to the destruction of much of your country, that was pretty bad, huh?), and decides that the worst</p><p>4 0.88736963 <a title="599-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-29-The_Subtle_Micro-Effects_of_Peacekeeping.html">242 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-29-The Subtle Micro-Effects of Peacekeeping</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Mvukiyehe and Cyrus Samii  write :
  
We [Mvukiyehe and Samii] use original survey data and administrative data to test a theory of the micro-level impacts of peacekeeping.  The theory proposes that through the creation of local security bubbles and also through direct assistance, peacekeeping deployments contribute to economic and social revitalization that may contribute to more durable peace.  This theory guides the design of current United Nations peacekeeping operations, and has been proposed as one of the explanations for peacekeeping’s well-documented association with more durable peace.


 Our evidence paint a complex picture that deviates substantially from the theory.  We do not find evidence for local security bubbles around deployment base areas, and we do not find that deployments were substantial contributors to local social infrastructure. In addition, we find a negative relationship between deployment basing locations and NGO contributions to social infrastructure.</p><p>5 0.87195581 <a title="599-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-25-A_question_about_the_Tiger_Mom%3A__what_if_she%E2%80%99d_had_boys_instead_of_girls%3F.html">1391 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-25-A question about the Tiger Mom:  what if she’d had boys instead of girls?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was just thinking about that Yale professor who wrote that book,  remember , she screamed at her daughters all the time and didn’t let them go the bathroom while they were practicing piano (violin?), Asian parenting-style etc etc.
 
I was just wondering . . . what if she’d had sons rather than daughters?  What are the rules?  Would bringing up boys be the job of mellow white dad rather than intense Asian mom?  If mom were still in charge, would the boys be doing piano, or something else like hockey?  Tiger Mom seems to be into traditional values so I’m assuming she’d want her kids doing something sex-stereotyped?  But sports would be tough, her (hypothetical) boys would have to compete with big strong athletes and would be less likely to be winners so then she couldn’t brag about her amazing parenting skills.
 
I really don’t know the answer to this one.  Maybe some of our readers who are Yale law professors can enlighten us?</p><p>6 0.87058473 <a title="599-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-11-My_talks_in_Bristol_this_Wed_and_London_this_Thurs.html">2207 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-11-My talks in Bristol this Wed and London this Thurs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here is my discussion of  a recent article  by David Spiegelhalter, Christopher 
Sherlaw-Johnson, Martin Bardsley, Ian Blunt, Christopher Wood and Olivia Grigg, that is scheduled to appear in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society:
 
I applaud the authors’ use of a mix of statistical methods to attack an important real-world problem. Policymakers need results right away, and I admire the authors’ ability and willingness to combine several different modeling and significance testing ideas for the purposes of rating and surveillance.
 
That said, I am uncomfortable with the statistical ideas here, for three reasons. First, I feel that the proposed methods, centered as they are around data manipulation and corrections for uncertainty, has serious defects compared to a more model-based approach. My problem with methods based on p-values and z-scores–however they happen to be adjusted–is that they draw discussion toward error rates, sequential analysis, and other technical statistical</p><p>3 0.11550133 <a title="783-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-14-The_statistics_and_the_science.html">146 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-14-The statistics and the science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yesterday I  posted  a review of a submitted manuscript where I first wrote that I read the paper only shallowly and then followed up with some suggestions on the statistical analysis, recommending that overdispersion be added to a fitted Posson regression and that the table of regression results be supplemented with a graph showing data and fitted lines.
 
A commenter asked why I wrote such an apparently shallow review, and I realized that some of the implications of my review were not as clear as I’d thought.  So let me clarify.
 
There is a connection between my general reaction and my statistical comments.  My statistical advice here is relevant for (at least) two reasons.  First, a Poisson regression without overdispersion will give nearly-uninterpretable standard errors, which means that I have no sense if the results are statistically significant as claimed.  Second, with a time series plot and regression table, but no graph showing the estimated treatment effect, it is very dif</p><p>4 0.11361811 <a title="783-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-17-Distorting_the_Electoral_Connection%3F_Partisan_Representation_in_Confirmation_Politics.html">152 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-17-Distorting the Electoral Connection?

<p>Introduction: John Kastellec, Jeff Lax, and Justin Phillips  write :
  
Do senators respond to the preferences of their statesâ&euro;&trade; median voters or only to the preferences of their co-partisans? We [Kastellec et al.] study responsiveness using roll call votes on ten recent Supreme Court nominations. We develop a method for estimating state-level public opinion broken down by partisanship.  We find that senators respond more powerfully to their partisan base when casting such roll call votes. Indeed, when their state median voter and party median voter disagree, senators strongly favor the latter.  [emphasis added] This has significant implications for the study of legislative responsiveness, the role of public opinion in shaping the personnel of the nations highest court, and the degree to which we should expect the Supreme Court to be counter-majoritarian. Our method can be applied elsewhere to estimate opinion by state and partisan group, or by many other typologies, so as to study other important qu</p><p>5 0.10939627 <a title="783-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-22-Tables_as_graphs%3A_The_Ramanujan_principle.html">1078 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-22-Tables as graphs: The Ramanujan principle</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tables are commonly read as crude graphs: what you notice in a table of numbers is (a) the minus signs, and thus which values are positive and which are negative, and (b) the length of each number, that is, its order of magnitude. The most famous example of such a read might be when the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan supposedly conjectured the asymptotic form of the partition function based on a look at a table of the first several partition numbers: he was essentially looking at a graph on the logarithmic scale.
 
I discuss some modern-day statistical examples in  this article for Significance magazine .

<p>Introduction: I saw an analysis recently that I didn’t like.  I won’t go into the details, but basically it was a dose-response inference, where a continuous exposure was binned into three broad categories (terciles of the data) and the probability of an adverse event was computed for each tercile.  The effect and the sample size was large enough that the terciles were statistically-significantly different from each other in probability of adverse event, with the probabilities increasing from low to mid to high exposure, as one would predict.
 
I didn’t like this analysis because it is equivalent to fitting a step function.  There is a tendency for people to interpret the (arbitrary) tercile boundaries as being meaningful thresholds even though the underlying dose-response relation has to be continuous.  I’d prefer to start with a linear model and then add nonlinearity from there with a spline or whatever.
 
At this point I stepped back and thought:  Hey, the divide-into-three analysis does not lite</p><p>3 0.74869645 <a title="783-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-28-This_is_a_link_to_a_news_article_about_a_scientific_paper.html">302 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-28-This is a link to a news article about a scientific paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Somebody I know sent me a link to  this news article  by Martin Robbins describing a potential scientific breakthrough.  I express some skepticism but in a vague enough way that, in the unlikely event that the research claim turns out to be correct, there’s no paper trail showing that I was wrong.  I have some comments on the graphs–the tables are horrible, no need to even discuss them!–and I’d prefer if the authors of the paper could display their data and model on a single graph.  I realize that their results reached a standard level of statistical significance, but it’s hard for me to interpret their claims until I see their estimates on some sort of direct real-world scale.  In any case, though, I’m sure these researchers are working hard, and I wish them the best of luck in their future efforts to replicate their findings.
 
I’m sure they’ll have no problem replicating, whether or not their claims are actually true.  That’s the way science works:  Once you know what you’re looking</p><p>4 0.74650311 <a title="783-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-10-Controversy_over_the_Christakis-Fowler_findings_on_the_contagion_of_obesity.html">757 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-10-Controversy over the Christakis-Fowler findings on the contagion of obesity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler are famous for finding that obesity is contagious.  Their claims, which have been received with both respect and skepticism (perhaps we need a new word for this:  “respecticism”?) are based on analysis of data from the Framingham heart study, a large longitudinal public-health study that happened to have some social network data (for the odd reason that each participant was asked to provide the name of a friend who could help the researchers locate them if they were to move away during the study period.
 
The short story is that if your close contact became obese, you were likely to become obese also.  The long story is a debate about the reliability of this finding (that is, can it be explained by measurement error and sampling variability) and its causal implications.
 
This sort of study is in my wheelhouse, as it were, but I have never looked at the Christakis-Fowler work in detail.  Thus, my previous and current comments are more along the line</p><p>5 0.73374218 <a title="783-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-11-The_happiness_gene%3A__My_bottom_line_%28for_now%29.html">706 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-11-The happiness gene:  My bottom line (for now)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a couple of email exchanges with Jan-Emmanuel De Neve and James Fowler, two of the authors of the article on the gene that is associated with life satisfaction which we  blogged  the other day.  (Bruno Frey, the third author of the article in question, is out of town according to his email.)  Fowler also commented  directly  on the blog.
 
I won’t go through all the details, but now I have a better sense of what’s going on.  (Thanks, Jan and James!)  Here’s my current understanding:
 
 1.   The original manuscript was divided into two parts:   an article  by De Neve alone published in the Journal of Human Genetics, and  an article  by De Neve, Fowler, Frey, and Nicholas Christakis submitted to Econometrica.  The latter paper repeats the analysis from the Adolescent Health survey and also replicates with data from the Framingham heart study (hence Christakis’s involvement).

<p>Introduction: Last week, as I walked into Andrew’s office for a meeting, he was 
formulating some misgivings about applying an ideal-point model to 
budgetary bills in the U.S. Senate.  Andrew didn’t like that the model 
of a senator’s position was an indifference point rather than at their 
optimal point, and that the effect of moving away from a position was 
automatically modeled as increasing in one direction and decreasing in 
the other.
 
 Executive Summary 
 
The monotonicity of inverse logit entails that the expected vote 
for a bill among any fixed collection of senators’ ideal points is 
monotonically increasing (or decreasing) with the bill’s position, 
with direction determined by the outcome coding.
 
 The Ideal-Point Model 
 

The ideal-point model’s easy to write down, but hard to reason about 
because of all the polarity shifting going on.  To recapitulate from 
Gelman and Hill’s 
  Regression

<p>Introduction: I received an email from the Royal Statistical Society asking if I wanted to submit a 400-word discussion to the article,  Vignettes and health systems responsiveness in cross-country comparative analyses  by Nigel Rice, Silvana Robone and Peter C. Smith.
 
My first thought was No, I can’t do it, I don’t know anything about health systems responsiveness etc.  But then I thought, sure, I always have  something  to say.  So I skimmed the article and was indeed motivated to write something.  Here’s what I sent in:
  
As a frequent user of survey data, I am happy to see this work on improving the reliability and validity of subjective responses.  My only comment is to recommend that the statistical sophistication that is evident in the in the design and modeling in this study be applied to the summaries as well.  I have three suggestions in particular.


First, I believe Figure 1 could be better presented as a series of line plots.  As it is, the heights of the purple and blue bars dominat</p><p>3 0.95425665 <a title="783-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-21-Avoiding_boundary_estimates_in_linear_mixed_models.html">918 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-21-Avoiding boundary estimates in linear mixed models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pablo Verde sends in  this letter  he and Daniel Curcio just published in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. They had published a meta-analysis with a boundary estimate which, he said, gave nonsense results.  Here’s Curcio and Verde’s key paragraph:
  
The authors [of the study they are criticizing] performed a test of heterogeneity between studies. Given that the test result was not significant at 5%, they decided to pool all the RRs by using a fixed-effect meta-analysis model. Unfortunately, this is a common practice in meta-analysis, which usually leads to very misleading results. First of all, the pooled RR as well as its standard	error are sensitive to 2 the estimation of the between-studies standard deviation (SD).	SD is difficult to estimate with a small number of studies. On the other hand, it is very well known that the significant test of hetero- geneity lacks statistical power to detect values of SD greater than zero. In addition, the statistically non-significant re</p><p>4 0.94234896 <a title="783-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-23-Thinking_outside_the_%28graphical%29_box%3A__Instead_of_arguing_about_how_best_to_fix_a_bar_chart%2C_graph_it_as_a_time_series_lineplot_instead.html">294 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-23-Thinking outside the (graphical) box:  Instead of arguing about how best to fix a bar chart, graph it as a time series lineplot instead</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Kastellec points me to  this blog  by Ezra Klein criticizing the following graph from a recent Republican Party report:
 
 
 
Klein (following  Alexander Hart ) slams the graph for not going all the way to zero on the y-axis, thus making the projected change seem bigger than it really is.
 
I agree with Klein and Hart that, if you’re gonna do a bar chart, you want the bars to go down to 0.  On the other hand, a projected change from 19% to 23% is actually pretty big, and I don’t see the point of using a graphical display that hides it.
 
 The solution:  Ditch the bar graph entirely and replace it by a lineplot , in particular, a time series with year-by-year data.  The time series would have several advantages:
 
1.  Data are placed in context.  You’d see every year, instead of discrete averages, and you’d get to see the changes in the context of year-to-year variation.
 
2.  With the time series, you can use whatever y-axis works with the data.  No need to go to zero.

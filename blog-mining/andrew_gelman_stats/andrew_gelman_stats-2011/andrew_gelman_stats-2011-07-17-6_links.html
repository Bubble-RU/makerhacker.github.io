<p>Introduction: Siobhan Mattison pointed me to  this .  I’m just disappointed they didn’t use my  Fenimore Cooper  line.  Although I guess that reference wouldn’t resonate much outside the U.S.
 
P.S.  My guess was correct   See comments below.  Actually, the reference probably wouldn’t resonate so well among under-50-year-olds in the U.S. either.  Sort of like the Jaycees story.</p><p>4 0.11402348 <a title="806-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-10-Aleks_says_this_is_the_future_of_visualization.html">795 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-10-Aleks says this is the future of visualization</a></p>

<p>Introduction: OK, the  30 days of statistics  are over.  I’ll still be posting regularly on statistical topics, but now it will be mixed in with everything else, as before.
 
Here’s what I put on the sister blogs in the past month:
 
1.  How to write  an entire report  with fake data.
 
2.  “Life getting shorter for women in hundreds of U.S. counties”:  I’d  like to see  a graph of relative change in death rates, with age on the x-axis.
 
3.   “Not a choice” != “genetic” .
 
4.  Remember when I said I’d never again post on albedo?  I was  lying .
 
5.  Update on Arrow’s theorem.  It’s  a Swiss thing , you wouldn’t understand.
 
6.  Dan Ariely can’t read, but  don’t blame  Johnson and Goldstein.
 
7.  My co-blogger endorses college scholarships for  bowling .  Which reminds me that my friends and I did “intramural bowling” in high school to get out of going to gym class.  Nobody paid us.  We even had to rent the shoes!

I just wanted to alert to this completely misinformed Politico article by Roger Simon, equating sampling theory with “magic.” Normally, I wouldn’t send you this, but I sent him a helpful email and he was a complete jerk about it.
  
Wow—this is really bad. It’s so bad I refuse to link to it. I don’t know who this dude is, but it’s pitiful. Andy Rooney could do better. And I don’t mean Andy Rooney in his prime, I mean Andy Rooney right now. The piece appears to be an attempt at jocularity, but it’s about 10 million times worse than whatever the worst thing is that Dave Barry has ever written.
 
My question to Neil Malhotra is . . . what made you click on this in the first place?

<p>Introduction: Sanjay Kaul wrotes:
  
By statute (“the least burdensome” pathway), the approval standard for devices by the US FDA is lower than for drugs. Before a new drug can be marketed, the sponsor must show “substantial evidence of effectiveness” as based on two or more well-controlled clinical studies (which literally means 2 trials, each with a p value of <0.05, or 1 large trial with a robust p value <0.00125). In contrast, the sponsor of a new device, especially those that are designated as high-risk (Class III) device, need only demonstrate "substantial equivalence" to an FDA-approved device via the 510(k) exemption or a "reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness", evaluated through a pre-market approval and typically based on a single study.


What does “reasonable assurance” or “substantial equivalence” imply to you as a Bayesian? These are obviously qualitative constructs, but if one were to quantify them, how would you go about addressing it?

Glenn Hubbard, Leading Academic and Mitt Romney Advisor, Took $1200 an Hour to Be Countrywide’s Expert Witness . . . Hidden among the reams of material recently filed in connection with the lawsuit of monoline insurer MBIA against Bank of America and Countrywide is a deposition of none other than Columbia University’s Glenn Hubbard. . . . Hubbard testified on behalf of Countrywide in the MBIA suit. He conducted an “analysis” that essentially concluded that Countrywide’s loans weren’t any worse than the loans produced by other mortgage originators, and that therefore the monstrous losses that investors in those loans suffered were due to other factors related to the economic crisis – and not caused by the serial misrepresentations and fraud in Countrywide’s underwriting.
  
That’s interesting, because I worked on the other side of this case!  I was hired by MBIA’s lawyers.

<p>Introduction: More and more I feel like economics reporting is based on crude principles of adding up “good news” and “bad news.”  Sometimes this makes sense:  by almost any measure, an unemployment rate of 10% is bad news compared to an unemployment rate of 5%.  Other times, though, the good/bad news framework seems so tangled.
 
For example:  house prices up is considered good news but inflation is considered bad news.  A strong dollar is considered good news but it’s also an unfavorable exchange rate, which is bad news.  When facebook shares go down, that’s bad news, but if they automatically go up, that means they were underpriced which doesn’t seem so good either.  Pundits are torn between rooting for the euro to fail (which means our team (the U.S.) is better than Europe (their team)) and rooting for it to survive (because a collapse in Europe is bad news for the U.S. economy).  China’s economy doing well is bad news—but if their economy slips, that’s bad news too.

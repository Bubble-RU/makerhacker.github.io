</p><p>2 In my experience, working conditions  can  make a difference. [sent-5, score-0.329]
</p><p>3 And once you accept this, it could very well make sense to put some effort into improving your work environment. [sent-6, score-0.129]
</p><p>4 I like to say that I spent twenty years reconstructing what it felt like to be in grad school. [sent-7, score-0.082]
</p><p>5 My ideal working environment has lots of people coming in and out, lots of opportunities for discussion, planned and otherwise. [sent-8, score-0.63]
</p><p>6 So I think Deaton is wrong to generalize to “don’t spend time trying to keep a very clean work environment” to “don’t spend time trying to get a setup that works for you. [sent-10, score-0.605]
</p><p>7 I like to feel that the efforts I put into my work environment have positive spillovers on others–the people I work with, the other people they work with, etc. [sent-13, score-0.693]
</p><p>8 , also as setting an example for others in the department. [sent-14, score-0.08]
</p><p>9 In contrast, people who want super-clean work conditions (the sort of thing that Deaton, rightly, is suspicious of) can impose negative externalities on others. [sent-15, score-0.566]
</p><p>10 For example, one of the faculty in my department once removed my course listings from the department webpage. [sent-16, score-0.407]
</p><p>11 I never got a straight answer on why this happened, but I assumed it was because he didn’t like what he taught, and it offended his sensibilities to see these courses listed. [sent-17, score-0.172]
</p><p>12 Removing the listing had the advantage from his perspective of cleanliness (I assume) but negatively impacted potential students and others who might have been interested in our course offerings. [sent-18, score-0.388]
</p><p>13 That is an extreme case, but I think many of us have experienced work environments in which intellectual interactions are discouraged in some way. [sent-19, score-0.348]
</p><p>14 Deaton concludes by asking his readers, “How ideal is ideal enough for you to do something great? [sent-22, score-0.593]
</p><p>15 ”  I agree with his point that there are diminishing returns to optimization and that you shouldn’t let difficulties with our workplace stop us from doing good work (unless, of course, you’re working somewhere where your employer gets possession of everything you do). [sent-23, score-0.672]
</p><p>16 But I am wary of his implicit statement that “you” (whoever you are) can “do something great. [sent-24, score-0.147]
</p><p>17 ”  I think we should all try to do our best, and I’m sure that almost all of us are capable of doing  good  work. [sent-25, score-0.149]
</p><p>18 But is everyone out there really situated in a place where he or she can “do something great”? [sent-26, score-0.155]
</p><p>19 Doing something “great” is a fine aspiration, but I wonder if some of this go-for-it advice can backfire for the people out there who really aren’t in a position to achieve greatness. [sent-28, score-0.309]

<p>Introduction: The deadline for this year’s Earth Institute postdocs is 1 Dec, so it’s time to  apply right away !  It’s a highly competitive interdisciplinary program, and we’ve had some statisticians in the past.
 
We’re particularly interested in statisticians who have research interests in development and public health. It’s fine–not just fine, but ideal–if you are interested in statistical methods also.</p><p>3 0.10495825 <a title="592-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-02-That_advice_not_to_work_so_hard.html">937 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-02-That advice not to work so hard</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We often hear that at the end of life, people often wish they hadn’t worked so hard.  (I’m assuming this is coming from executive types who have the option of working less, not people who had to work hard just to put food on the table.)
 
I don’t understand this.  Work is ok, but in almost any moment I much prefer relaxing to working.  Nonetheless I often wish I were working harder or had worked harder.  I don’t feel that I work too much.
 
So I don’t know what to think.  Am I just unusual?  Or maybe I already don’t work so hard, so there’s nothing for me to regret?  Or—and this is the scary option—maybe  right now  I wish I were working harder, but in twenty years I’ll regret that I spent so much time working?
 
Here’s one thing.  I like almost all the research papers I’ve written, but the vast majority (including some of my favorites) have had very few citations and, I assume, very little impact.  So maybe I worked too hard on some of them?</p><p>4 0.10048272 <a title="592-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-09-Advice%3A__positive-sum%2C_zero-sum%2C_or_negative-sum.html">2287 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-09-Advice:  positive-sum, zero-sum, or negative-sum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a lot of free advice out there. I offer some of it myself!  As I’ve written before (see  this post from 2008  reacting to this advice from Dan Goldstein for business school students, and  this post from 2010  reacting to some general advice from Nassim Taleb), what we see is typically presented as advice to individuals, but it’s also interesting to consider the possible total effects if the advice is taken.
 
It’s time to play the game again.  This time it’s  advice from sociologist Fabio Rojas  for Ph.D. students.  I’ll copy his eight points of advice, then, for each, evaluate whether I think it is positive or negative sum: 
  
  
1. Show up. Even if you feel horrible, show up. No matter what. Period. Unless someone died in your family, show up. 
2. Do your job. Grade the papers. Do the lab work. Unless the work is extreme, take it in stride. 
3. Be completely realistic about how you will be evaluated from day #1 – acquire a teaching record and a record of publication.

<p>Introduction: I’m a physicist by training, statistical data analyst by trade.  Although some of my work is pretty standard statistical analysis, more often I work somewhere in a gray area that includes physics, engineering, and statistics. I have very little formal statistics training but I do study in an academic-like way to learn techniques from the literature when I need to.  I do some things well but there are big gaps in my stats knowledge compared to anyone who has gone to grad school in statistics.  On the other hand, there are big gaps in most statisticians’ physics and engineering knowledge compared to anyone who has gone to grad school in physics. Generally my breadth and depth of knowledge is about right for the kind of work that I do, I think. 
 
But last week I was offered a consulting job that might be better done by someone with more conventional stats knowledge than I have.  The job involves gene expression in different types of tumors, so it’s “biostatistics” by definition, but the</p><p>6 0.094524026 <a title="592-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-13-A_departmental_wiki_page%3F.html">571 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-13-A departmental wiki page?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After  posting  on David Rubinstein’s remarks on his “cushy life” as a sociology professor at a public university, I read  these remarks  by some of Rubinstein’s colleagues at the University of Illinois, along with a response from Rubinstein.
 
Before getting to the policy issues, let me first say that I think it must have been so satisfying, first for Rubinstein and then for his colleagues (Barbara Risman, William Bridges, and Anthony Orum) to publish these notes.  We all have people we know and hate, but we rarely have a good excuse for blaring our feelings in public. (I remember when I was up for tenure, I was able to read the outside letters on my case (it’s a public university and they have rules), and one of the letter writers really hated my guts.  I was surprised–I didn’t know the guy well (the letters were anonymized but it was clear from context who the letter writer was) but the few times we’d met, he’d been cordial enough–but there you have it.

<p>Introduction: Sining Chen told me they’re hiring in the  statistics group at Bell Labs .  I’ll do my bit for economic stimulus by announcing this job (see below).
 
I love Bell Labs.  I worked there for three summers, in a physics lab in 1985-86 under the supervision of Loren Pfeiffer, and by myself in the statistics group in 1990.
 
I learned a lot working for Loren.  He was a really smart and driven guy.  His lab was a small set of rooms—in Bell Labs, everything’s in a small room, as they value the positive externality of close physical proximity of different labs, which you get by making each lab compact—and it was Loren, his assistant (a guy named Ken West who kept everything running in the lab), and three summer students: me, Gowton Achaibar, and a girl whose name I’ve forgotten.  Gowtan and I had a lot of fun chatting in the lab.

He sometimes came to the statistics department seminar and we got to talking about various things; in particular we shared an interest in statistical graphics.  Much of my work in this direction eventually went toward the use of graphical displays to understand fitted models.  Seth went in another direction and got interested in the role of exploratory data analysis in science, the idea that we could use graphs not just to test or even understand a model but also as the source of new hypotheses.  We continued to discuss these issues over the years;  see here , for example.
 
At some point when we were at Berkeley the administration was encouraging the faculty to teach freshman seminars, and I had the idea of teaching a course on left-handedness.  I’d just read the book by Stanley Coren and thought it would be fun to go through it with a class, chapter by chapter.  But my knowledge of psych</p><p>6 0.85382557 <a title="592-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-02-That_advice_not_to_work_so_hard.html">937 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-02-That advice not to work so hard</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve become increasingly uncomfortable with the term “confidence interval,” for several reasons:
 
- The well-known difficulties in interpretation (officially the confidence statement can be interpreted only on average, but people typically implicitly give the Bayesian interpretation to each case),
 
- The ambiguity between confidence intervals and predictive intervals.  (See the footnote in BDA where we discuss the difference between “inference” and “prediction” in the classical framework.)
 
- The awkwardness of explaining that confidence intervals are big in noisy situations where you have  less  confidence, and confidence intervals are small when you have  more  confidence.
 
So here’s my proposal.  Let’s use the term “uncertainty interval” instead.  The uncertainty interval tells you how much uncertainty you have.  That works pretty well, I think.
 
P.S.  As of this writing, “confidence interval” outGoogles “uncertainty interval” by the huge margin of 9.5 million to 54000.

<p>Introduction: Two positions open  in the statistics group at the NYU education school.  If you get the job, you get to work with Jennifer HIll!
 
One position is a postdoctoral fellowship, and the other is a visiting professorship.  The latter position requires “the demonstrated ability to develop a nationally recognized research program,” which seems like a lot to ask for a visiting professor.  Do they expect the visiting prof to develop a nationally recognized research program and then leave it there at NYU after the visit is over?
 
In any case, Jennifer and her colleagues are doing excellent work, both applied and methodological, and this seems like a great opportunity.</p><p>3 0.96820277 <a title="592-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-18-The_treatment%2C_the_intermediate_outcome%2C_and_the_ultimate_outcome%3A__Leverage_and_the_financial_crisis.html">1420 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-18-The treatment, the intermediate outcome, and the ultimate outcome:  Leverage and the financial crisis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gur Huberman points to an article on the financial crisis by Bethany McLean, who  writes :
  
lthough our understanding of what instigated the 2008 global financial crisis remains at best incomplete, there are a few widely agreed upon contributing factors. One of them is a 2004 rule change by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allowed investment banks to load up on leverage.


This disastrous decision has been cited by a host of prominent economists, including Princeton professor and former Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman Alan Blinder and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz. It has even been immortalized in Hollywood, figuring into the dark financial narrative that propelled the Academy Award-winning film Inside Job. . . .


Here’s just one problem with this story line: It’s not true. Nor is it hard to prove that. Look at the historical leverage of the big five investment banks — Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

<p>Introduction: The Center for the Promotion of Research Involving Innovative Statistical Methodology at the Steinhardt School of Education has  two job openings !  One is for an assistant/associated tenure track position for an applied statistician or psychometrician.  The other is for a postdoc in causal inference and sensitivity analysis.
 
Jennifer Hill and Marc Scott at the Steinhardt school are just great!  Weâ&euro;&trade;re working together on various research projects so if you manage to get one of these jobs maybe you can collaborate with us here at Columbia too.  So I have every interest in encouraging the very best people to apply for these jobs.</p><p>5 0.9640224 <a title="592-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-19-Demystifying_Blup.html">1270 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-19-Demystifying Blup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In our recent thread on computing hierarchical models with big datasets, someone  brought up  Blup.  I thought it might be worth explaining what Blup is and how it relates to hierarchical models.
 
Blup stands for Best Linear Unbiased Prediction, but in my terminology it’s just hierarchical modeling.  Let me break it down: 
- “Best” doesn’t really matter.  What’s important is that our estimates and predictions make sense and are as accurate as possible. 
- “Linear” isn’t so important.  Statistical predictions are linear for Gaussian linear models, otherwise not.  We can and do perform hierarchical generalized linear models all the time. 
- “Unbiased” doesn’t really matter (see discussion of “Best,” above). 
- “Prediction” is the key word for relating Blup and hierarchical modeling to classical statistical terminology.  In classical statistics, “estimation” of a parameter theta is evaluated conditional on the true value of theta, whereas “prediction” of a predictive quantity phi is eval</p><p>6 0.96121991 <a title="592-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-13-Meritocracy_rerun.html">1937 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-13-Meritocracy rerun</a></p>

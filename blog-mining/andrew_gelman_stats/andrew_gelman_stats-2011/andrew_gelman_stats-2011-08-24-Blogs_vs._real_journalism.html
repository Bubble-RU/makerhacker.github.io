Yup.  Worse than talk radio.  Worse than cave painting.  Worse than smoke signals, rock ‘n’ roll lyrics, woodcuts, spray-paint graffiti, and every other medium of communication ever invented.
 
OK, he didn’t really mean it.  Rauch actually has an ironclad argument here.  He’s claiming, in a blog, that blogging is crap.  Therefore, if he fills his blog with unsupported exaggerations, that’s fine, as he’s demonstrating that blogging is . . . crap.

<p>Introduction: Journalist Jonathan Rauch  writes  that the internet is Sturgeon squared:
  
This is the blogosphere. I’m not getting paid to be here. I’m here to get incredibly famous (in my case, even more incredibly famous) so that I can get paid somewhere else. . . .


The average quality of newspapers and (published) novels is far, far better than the average quality of blog posts (and–ugh!–comments). This is because people pay for newspapers and novels. What distinguishes newspapers and novels is how much does not get published in them, because people won’t pay for it. Payment is a filter, and a pretty good one. Imperfect, of course. But pointing out the defects of the old model is merely changing the subject if the new model is worse. . . .


Yes, the new model is bringing a lot of new content into being. But most of it is bad. And it’s displacing a lot of better content, by destroying the business model for quality. Even in the information economy, there’s no free lunch. . . .

<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  links  to an interview with Seth Godin, who makes some commonplace but useful observations on jobs and careers.  It’s fine, but whenever I read this sort of thing, I get annoyed by the super-aggressive writing style.  These internet guys–Seth Godin, Clay Shirky, Philip Greenspun, Jeff Jarvis, and so on–are always getting in your face, telling you how everything you thought was true was wrong.  Some of the things these guys say are just silly (for example, Godin’s  implication  that Bob Dylan is more of a success than the Monkees because Dylan sells more tickets), other times they have interesting insights, but reading any of them for awhile just sets me on edge.  I can’t take being shouted at, and I get a little tired of hearing over and over again that various people, industries, etc., are dinosaurs.

<p>Introduction: Rajiv Sethi  writes :
  
I suspect that within a decade, blogs will be a cornerstone of research in economics. Many original and creative contributions to the discipline will first be communicated to the profession (and the world at large) in the form of blog posts, since the medium allows for material of arbitrary length, depth and complexity. Ideas first expressed in this form will make their way (with suitable attribution) into reading lists, doctoral dissertations and more conventionally refereed academic publications. And blogs will come to play a central role in the process of recruitment, promotion and reward at major research universities. This genie is not going back into its bottle.
  
And he thinks this is a good thing:
  
In fact, the refereeing process for blog posts is in some respects more rigorous than that for journal articles. Reports are numerous, non-anonymous, public, rapidly and efficiently produced, and collaboratively constructed. It is not obvious to me [Sethi]</p><p>6 0.10874875 <a title="868-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-02-Note_to_the_quals.html">124 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-02-Note to the quals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Even within the realm of writing-about-statistics, there are things I can say in a blog that are much more difficult to include in an academic article.  Blogging gives me freedom.
 
But I want to distinguish between two different sorts of frankness.
 
1.  Obnoxiousness:  In a blog I can write, “I hate X” as rudely as I’d like without needing to justify myself.
 
2.  Openness:  In a blog I can write about the limitations of my work.  It’s a real challenge to discuss limitations in a scholarly article, as we’re always looking over our shoulder at what referees might think.  Sure, sometimes I can get away with  writing  “Survey weighting is a mess,” but my impression is that most scholarly articles are relentlessly upbeat.  Sort of like how a magazine article typically will have a theme and just plug it over and over.  In a blog we can more easily admit uncertainty.
 
Overall, I think blogs are more celebrated for feature 1 above (the freedom to say what you  really  feel, to be rude, par</p><p>5 0.83874458 <a title="868-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-04-Someone_is_wrong_on_the_internet.html">1561 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-04-Someone is wrong on the internet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I made the mistake of googling myself (I know, I know . . .) and came across a couple of rude bloggers criticizing something I’d written.  I don’t mind criticism, and lord knows I can be a rude blogger myself at times, but these criticisms were really bad, a mix of already-refuted arguments and new claims that were just flat-out ridiculous.  Really bad stuff.  I then spent about an hour, on and off, writing a long long post explaining why they were wrong and how they could make their arguments better.  But then, before I hit Send, I realized it would a mistake to post my response.  Getting into a fight with these people whom I’d never heard of before . . . what’s the point?  If they want to comment on my blog, I will respond (within reason), or if they are well known researchers or journalists, it’s perhaps worth correcting them.  Or if they made an interesting argument, sure.  But there’s no point in scouring the web looking for  bad  arguments to refute.  That way lies madness.

What do you think about the “random rejection” method used by PPP that was attacked at some length today by a Republican pollster.  Our just published post on the debate  includes all the details as I know them. The  Storify of Martino’s tweets  has some additional data tables linked to toward the end.  


Also, more specifically, setting aside Martino’s suggestion of manipulation (which is also quite possible with post-stratification weights), would the PPP method introduce more potential random error than weighting? 
  
From Blumenthal’s blog:
  
B.J. Martino, a senior vice president at the Republican polling firm The Tarrance Group, went on an 30-minute Twitter rant on Tuesday questioning the unorthodox method used by PPP [Public Policy Polling] to select samples and weight data: “Looking at @ppppolls new VA SW.

Regular blog readers know all about this topic.  ( Here  are the slides.)  But, rest assured, I donâ&euro;&trade;t just mock. I also offer constructive suggestions.
 
My last talk at Northwestern was fifteen years ago.  Actually, I gave two lectures then, in the process of  being turned down for a job enjoying their chilly Midwestern hospitality.

<p>Introduction: I was thinking a bit more about  Jonathan Rauch’s lament  about the fading of  the buggy-whip industry  print journalism, in which he mocks bloggers, analogizes blogging to scribbling with spray paint on the side of a building, and writes that the blogosphere is “the single worst medium for sustained, and therefore grown-up, reading and writing and argumentation ever invented.”
 
Yup.  Worse than talk radio.  Worse than cave painting.  Worse than smoke signals, rock ‘n’ roll lyrics, woodcuts, spray-paint graffiti, and every other medium of communication ever invented.
 
OK, he didn’t really mean it.  Rauch actually has an ironclad argument here.  He’s claiming, in a blog, that blogging is crap.  Therefore, if he fills his blog with unsupported exaggerations, that’s fine, as he’s demonstrating that blogging is . . . crap.
 
Not to pile on, but, hey, why not?  I was curious what Rauch has blogged on lately, so I googled Jonathan Rauch blog and ended up at  this site , which most recently</p><p>5 0.93250751 <a title="868-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-23-Of_hypothesis_tests_and_Unitarians.html">1024 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-23-Of hypothesis tests and Unitarians</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Xian, Judith, and I read this line in a book by statistician Murray Aitkin in which he considered the following hypothetical example:
  
A survey of 100 individuals expressing support (Yes/No) for the president, before and after a presidential address . . . The question of interest is whether there has been a change in support between the surveys . . . We want to assess the evidence for the hypothesis of equality H1 against the alternative hypothesis H2 of a change.
  
Here is  our response :
  
Based on our experience in public opinion research, this is not a real question. Support for any political position is always changing. The real question is how much the support has changed, or perhaps how this change is distributed across the population.


A defender of Aitkin (and of classical hypothesis testing) might respond at this point that, yes, everybody knows that changes are never exactly zero and that we should take a more “grown-up” view of the null hypothesis, not that the change</p><p>6 0.92797232 <a title="868-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-10-18-IRB_nightmares.html">1539 andrew gelman stats-2012-10-18-IRB nightmares</a></p>

Towards a Theory of Trust in Networks of Humans and Computers   


Virgil Gligor Carnegie Mellon University 


We argue that a general theory of trust in networks of humans and computers must be build on both a theory of behavioral trust and a theory of computational trust. This argument is motivated by increased participation of people in social networking, crowdsourcing, human computation, and socio-economic protocols, e.g., protocols modeled by trust and gift-exchange games, norms-establishing contracts, and scams/deception. User participation in these protocols relies primarily on trust, since on-line verification of protocol compliance is often impractical; e.g., verification can lead to undecidable problems, co-NP complete test procedures, and user inconvenience. Trust is captured by participant preferences (i.e., risk and betrayal aversion) and beliefs in the trustworthiness of other protocol participants. Both preferences and beliefs can be enhanced</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 This argument is motivated by increased participation of people in social networking, crowdsourcing, human computation, and socio-economic protocols, e.

<p>Introduction: Richard Thaler writes (click  here  and search on Thaler):
  
Both risk and risk aversion are concepts that were once well defined, but are now in danger of becoming Aetherized [this is Thaler's term for adding free parameters to a model to make it work, thus destroying the purity and much of the value of the original model]. Stocks that earn surprisingly high returns are labeled as risky, because in the theory, excess returns must be accompanied by higher risk. If, inconveniently, the traditional measures of risk such as variance or covariance with the market are not high, then the Aetherists tell us there must be some other risk; we just don’t know what it is.


Similarly, traditionally the concept of risk aversion was taken to be a primitive; each person had a parameter, gamma, that measured her degree of risk aversion. Now risk aversion is allowed to be time varying, and Aetherists can say with a straight face that the market crashes of 2001 and 2008 were caused by sudden increases</p><p>5 0.10360553 <a title="1051-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-10-Don%E2%80%99t_trust_the_Turk.html">1932 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-10-Don’t trust the Turk</a></p>

The Human Social Dynamics Group in Yahoo Research is seeking highly qualified candidates for a post-doctoral research scientist position.


The Human and Social Dynamics group is devoted to understanding the interplay between individual-level behavior (e.g. how people make decisions about what music they like, which dates to go on, or which groups to join) and the social environment in which individual behavior necessarily plays itself out. In particular, we are interested in:


* Structure and evolution of social groups and networks 
* Decision making, social influence, diffusion, and collective decisions 
* Networking and collaborative problem solving.


The intrinsically multi-disciplinary and cross-cutting nature of the subject demands an eclectic range of researchers, both in terms of domain-expertise  (e.g. decision sciences, social psychology, sociology) and technical skills (e.g. statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulations, design o</p><p>3 0.67269397 <a title="1051-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-10-The_blog_of_the_Cultural_Cognition_Project.html">1111 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-10-The blog of the Cultural Cognition Project</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan and colleagues  write :
  
The Cultural Cognition Project is a group of scholars interested in studying how cultural values shape public risk perceptions and related policy beliefs.   Cultural cognition refers to the tendency of individuals to conform their beliefs about disputed matters of fact (e.g., whether global warming is a serious threat; whether the death penalty deters murder; whether gun control makes society more safe or less) to values that define their cultural identities. Project members are using the methods of various disciplines — including social psychology, anthropology, communications, and political science — to chart the impact of this phenomenon and to identify the mechanisms through which it operates. The Project also has an explicit normative objective: to identify processes of democratic decisionmaking by which society can resolve culturally grounded differences in belief in a manner that is both congenial to persons of diverse cultural outlooks and c</p><p>4 0.65487951 <a title="1051-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-03-%E2%80%9CThe_Case_for_Inductive_Theory_Building%E2%80%9D.html">1652 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-03-“The Case for Inductive Theory Building”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Professor of business management Edwin Locke sent me  an article :
  
This paper argues that theory building in the social sciences, management and psychology included, should be inductive. It begins by critiquing contemporary philosophy of science, e.g., Popper’s falsifiability theory, his stress on deduction, and the hypothetico-deductive method. Next I present some history of the concept of induction in philosophy and of inductive theory building in the hard sciences (e.g., Aristotle, Bacon, Newton). This is followed by three examples of successful theory building by induction in psychology and management (Beck’s theory, Bandura’s social-cognitive theory, goal setting theory). The paper concludes with some suggested guidelines for successful theory building through induction and some new policies that journal editors might encourage.
  
Like most social scientists (but maybe not most  Bayesians ), I’m pretty much a  Popperian  myself, so I was interested to see someone taking such a</p><p>5 0.64527005 <a title="1051-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-18-Postdoc_positions_at_Microsoft_Research_%E2%80%93_NYC.html">1630 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-18-Postdoc positions at Microsoft Research – NYC</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey,  this  looks cool: 
  
Towards a Theory of Trust in Networks of Humans and Computers   


Virgil Gligor Carnegie Mellon University 


We argue that a general theory of trust in networks of humans and computers must be build on both a theory of behavioral trust and a theory of computational trust. This argument is motivated by increased participation of people in social networking, crowdsourcing, human computation, and socio-economic protocols, e.g., protocols modeled by trust and gift-exchange games, norms-establishing contracts, and scams/deception. User participation in these protocols relies primarily on trust, since on-line verification of protocol compliance is often impractical; e.g., verification can lead to undecidable problems, co-NP complete test procedures, and user inconvenience. Trust is captured by participant preferences (i.e., risk and betrayal aversion) and beliefs in the trustworthiness of other protocol participants. Both preferences and beliefs can be enhanced</p><p>2 0.89123273 <a title="1051-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-16-Zero_Dark_Thirty_and_Bayes%E2%80%99_theorem.html">1724 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-16-Zero Dark Thirty and Bayes’ theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A moviegoing colleague writes:
  
I just watched the movie Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.  What struck me about it was: (1) Bayes theorem underlies the whole movie; (2) CIA top brass do not know Bayes theorem (at least as portrayed in the movie).


Obviously one does not need to know physics to play billiards, but it helps with the reasoning.


Essentially, at some point the key CIA agent locates what she strongly believes is OBL’s hidding place in Pakistan.  Then it takes the White House some 150 days to make the decision to attack the compound.  Why so long? And why, even on the eve of the operation, were senior brass only some 60% OBL was there?  


Fear of false positives is the answer.  After all, the compound could belong to a drug lord, or some other terrorist.  Here is the math:


There are two possibilities, according to movie: OBL is in a compound (C) in a city or he is in the mountains in tribal regions.  Say P(OBL in C) = 0.5.

Gronke et al. write (as excerpted by Sides):
  
Many journalists and politicians believe that during the Bush administration, a majority of Americans supported torture if they were assured that it would prevent a terrorist attack….But this view was a misperception…we show here that a majority of Americans were opposed to torture throughout the Bush presidency…even when respondents were asked about an imminent terrorist attack, even when enhanced interrogation techniques were not called torture, and even when Americans were assured that torture would work to get crucial information. Opposition to torture remained stable and consistent during the entire Bush presidency.
  
Gronke et al. attribute confusion of beliefs to the so-called false consensus effect studied by cognitive psychologists, in which people tend to assume th</p><p>6 0.8590008 <a title="1051-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-19-Retraction_watch.html">1770 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-19-Retraction watch</a></p>

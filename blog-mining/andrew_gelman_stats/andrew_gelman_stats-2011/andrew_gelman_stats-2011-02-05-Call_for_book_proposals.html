<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes with two interesting questions involving time series analysis:
  
 
I used to work in an organization that designed and made signal processing equipment.  Antialiasing and windowing of time series was a big deal in performing analysis accurately.  


Now I’m in a place where I have to make inferences about human-scaled time series.  It has dawned on me that the two are related.  I’m not sure we often have data sampled at a rate at least twice the highest frequency present (not just the highest frequency of interest).  The only articles I’ve seen about aliasing as applied to social science series are from  Hinich  or from  related works .  Box and Jenkins hint at it in section 13.3 of Time Series Analysis, but the analysis seems to be mostly heuristic.  Yet I can imagine all sorts of time series subject to similar problems, from analyses of stock prices based on closing prices (mentioned in the latter article) to other economic series measured on a monthly basis to en</p><p>4 0.12411376 <a title="557-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-18-Postdoc_positions_at_Microsoft_Research_%E2%80%93_NYC.html">1630 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-18-Postdoc positions at Microsoft Research – NYC</a></p>

The Human Social Dynamics Group in Yahoo Research is seeking highly qualified candidates for a post-doctoral research scientist position.


The Human and Social Dynamics group is devoted to understanding the interplay between individual-level behavior (e.g. how people make decisions about what music they like, which dates to go on, or which groups to join) and the social environment in which individual behavior necessarily plays itself out. In particular, we are interested in:


* Structure and evolution of social groups and networks 
* Decision making, social influence, diffusion, and collective decisions 
* Networking and collaborative problem solving.


The intrinsically multi-disciplinary and cross-cutting nature of the subject demands an eclectic range of researchers, both in terms of domain-expertise  (e.g. decision sciences, social psychology, sociology) and technical skills (e.g. statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulations, design o</p><p>3 0.80822361 <a title="557-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-10-Jobs_in_statistics_research%21__In_New_Jersey%21.html">1110 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-10-Jobs in statistics research!

The Statistics Research group in AT&T; Labs invites applications for full time research positions. Applicants should have a Ph.D. in Statistics (or a related field), and be able to make major, widely-recognized contributions to statistics research: theory, methods, computing, and data analysis. Candidates must demonstrate a potential for excellence in research, a knowledge of fundamental statistical theory, a collaborative spirit, and strong communication skills.  We are especially interested in statisticians who are interested in and capable of working on large scale data problems.  A non-exclusive list of statistical fields we are interested in include: data mining, statistical computing, forecasting, time series, spatial statistics, social networks, machine learning, and Bayesian analysis.


We invite applications from both new and experienced Ph.Ds, and women and underrepresented minorities are especially encouraged to apply.

<p>Introduction: Postdoctoral position in statistical modeling of social networks 
 
A full-time postdoctoral position is available beginning Fall 2014 in the research group of Tian Zheng and Andrew Gelman working on statistical analysis and modeling of social network data, in close cooperation with our experimental collaborators. Four key papers of this project so far are:
 
http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/overdisp_final.pdf

http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.2473.pdf
 
Requirements: The work is highly interdisciplinary, and applicants must have strong statistical and computational skills.  Social science research skills are preferred but not necessary. Preferred educational background is a PhD in statistics, computer science, political science, sociology, or a related field. Expertise in Bayesian modeling and computing is required.

<p>Introduction: Paging Uri Simonsohn . . .
 
January 2014:  Alice Robb  writes , completely uncritically: “If Your Name is Dennis, You’re More Likely to Become a Dentist The strange science of how names shape careers.”
 
But look what you can learn from a quick google:
 
 
 
Hmmmm, maybe worth following up on that second link . . . 
 
More details  here , from 2011:
  
Devah Pager points me to  this article  by Uri Simonsohn, which begins:

 
Three articles published [by Brett Pelham et al.] have shown that a disproportionate share of people choose spouses, places to live, and occupations with names similar to their own. These findings, interpreted as evidence of implicit egotism, are included in most modern social psychology textbooks and many university courses. The current article successfully replicates the original findings but shows that they are most likely caused by a combination of cohort, geographic, and ethnic confounds as well as reverse causality.

<p>Introduction: Peter Woit  links  to Steve Hsu  linking  to a 1977  interview  by Katherine Sopka of physics professor Sidney Coleman.
 
I don’t know anything about Coleman’s research but the interview caught my eye because one of my roommates in grad school was one of Coleman’s advisees.
 
Anyway, here’s the key bit from the interview:
  
Sopka:  But you do enjoy working with students or do you?


Coleman:  No. I hate it. You do it as part of the job. Well, that’s of course false…or maybe more true than false when I say I hate it. Occasionally there’s a student who is a joy to work with. But I certainly would be just as happy if I had no graduate students…


Sopka:  I guess your remark means then that you would like to avoid teaching undergraduate courses or even required graduate courses…


Coleman:  Or even special topics courses. Teaching is unpleasant work. No question about it. It has its rewards. One feels happy about having a job well done.

From Simonsohn’s article, here’s a handy summary of the claims and the evidence (click on it to enlarge):
 
   
 
The Pelham et al. articles have come up several times on the blog, starting with  this discussion  and  this estimate  and then more recently  here .

<p>Introduction: James Druckman and Jeremy Freese write: 
  
  
We are pleased to announce that Time-Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS) was renewed for another round of funding by NSF starting last Fall. TESS allows researchers to submit proposals for experiments to be conducted on a nationally-representative, probability-based Internet platform, and successful proposals are fielded at no cost to investigators.  More information about how TESS works and how to submit proposals is available at http://www.tessexperiments.org.


Additionally, we are pleased to announce the development of two new proposal mechanisms. TESS’s Short Studies Program (SSP) is accepting proposals for fielding very brief population-based survey experiments on a general population of at least 2000 adults. SSP recruits participants from within the U.S. using the same Internet-based platform as other TESS studies. More information about SSP and proposal requirements is available at http://www.tessexperiments.org/ssp.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.92885774 <a title="557-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-05-Call_for_book_proposals.html">557 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-05-Call for book proposals</a></p>

Large and complex datasets are becoming prevalent in the social and behavioral sciences and statistical methods are crucial for the analysis and interpretation of such data. The Chapman & Hall/CRC Statistics in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Series aims to capture new developments in statistical methodology with particular relevance to applications in the social and behavioral sciences. It seeks to promote appropriate use of statistical, econometric and psychometric methods in these applied sciences by publishing a broad range of monographs, textbooks and handbooks.


The scope of the series is wide, including applications of statistical methodology in sociology, psychology, economics, education, marketing research, political science, criminology, public policy, demography, survey methodology and official statistics. The titles included in the series are designed to appeal to applied statisticians, as well as students, researchers and practitioners from the</p><p>6 0.91811383 <a title="557-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-24-Erving_Goffman_archives.html">365 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-24-Erving Goffman archives</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Bill Harris writes:
  
I’ve read your  paper  and  presentation  showing why you don’t usually worry about multiple comparisons.  I see how that applies when you are comparing results across multiple settings (states, etc.).


Does the same principle hold when you are exploring data to find interesting relationships?  For example, you have some data, and you’re trying a series of models to see which gives you the most useful insight.  Do you try your models on a subset of the data so you have another subset for confirmatory analysis later, or do you simply throw all the data against your models?
  
My reply:  I’d like to estimate all the relationships at once and use a multilevel model to do partial pooling to handle the mutiplicity issues.  That said, in practice, in my applied work I’m always bouncing back and forth between different hypotheses and different datasets, and often I learn a lot when next year’s data come in and I can modify my hypotheses.

<p>Introduction: This is a long and technical post on an important topic:  the use of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to estimate state-level public opinion.  MRP as a research method, and state-level opinion (or, more generally, attitudes in demographic and geographic subpopulation) as a subject, have both become increasingly important in political science—and soon, I expect, will become increasingly important in other social sciences as well.  Being able to estimate state-level opinion from national surveys is just such a powerful thing, that if it can be done, people will do it.  It’s taken 15 years or so for the method to really catch on, but the ready availability of survey data and of computing power—as well as our increasing comfort level, as a profession, with these techniques, has made MRP become more of a routine research tool.
 
As a method becomes used more and more widely, there will be natural concerns about its domains of applicability.  That is the subject of the pres</p><p>5 0.1322704 <a title="544-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-10-Do_you_believe_that_%E2%80%9Chumans_and_other_living_things_have_evolved_over_time%E2%80%9D%3F.html">2167 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-10-Do you believe that “humans and other living things have evolved over time”?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day on the sister blog we  discussed  a recent Pew Research survey that seemed to show that Republicans are becoming more partisan about evolution (or, as Paul Krugman put it, “So what happened after 2009 that might be driving Republican views? . . . Republicans are being driven to identify in all ways with their tribe — and the tribal belief system is dominated by anti-science fundamentalists”).
 
We presented some discussion and evidence from Dan Kahan suggesting that the evidence for such a change was not so clear at all.  Kahan drew his conclusions from a more detailed analysis of the much-discussed Pew data, along with a comparison to a recent Gallup poll.
 
Also following up on this is sociologist David Wealiem, who pulls some more data into the discussion:

<p>Introduction: Jeff Helzner writes:
  
A friend of mine and I  cited  your  open data article  in our attempts to persuade a professor at another institution [Brian Leiter] into releasing the raw data from his influential rankings of philosophy departments. He is now claiming the national security response:

 
. . . disclosing the reputational data would violate the terms on  which the evaluators agreed to complete the surveys (did they even bother to read the description of the methodology, one wonders?).
 

I [Helzner] do not find this to be a compelling reply in this case. In fact, I  would say that when such data cannot be disclosed it reveals a flaw in the design of the survey. Experimental designs must be open so  that others can run the experiment. Mathematical proofs must be open so that they can be reviewed by others. Likewise, it seems to me that the details of statistical argument should be open to inspection. Do you have any thoughts on this?

<p>Introduction: Someone writes:
  
Suppose I have two groups of people, A and B, which differ on some characteristic of interest to me;  and for each person I measure a single real-valued quantity X.  I have a theory that group A has a higher mean value of X than group B.  I test this theory by using a t-test.  Am I entitled to use a *one-tailed* t-test?  Or should I use a *two-tailed* one (thereby giving a p-value that is twice as large)?


I know you will probably answer:  Forget the t-test; you should use Bayesian methods instead.


But what is the standard frequentist answer to this question?
  
My reply:
 
The quick answer here is that different people will do different things here.  I would say the 2-tailed p-value is more standard but some people will insist on the one-tailed version, and itâ&euro;&trade;s hard to make a big stand on this one, given all the other problems with p-values in practice:

<p>Introduction: Fabio Rojas points me to  this excellently-titled working paper  by Joseph DiGrazia, Karissa McKelvey, Johan Bollen, and himself:
  
Is social media a valid indicator of political behavior? We answer this ques- tion using a random sample of 537,231,508 tweets from August 1 to November 1, 2010 and data from 406 competitive U.S. congressional elections provided by the Federal Election Commission. Our results show that the percentage of Republican-candidate name mentions correlates with the Republican vote margin in the subsequent election. This finding persists even when controlling for incumbency, district partisanship, media coverage of the race, time, and demographic variables such as the district’s racial and gender composi- tion. With over 500 million active users in 2012, Twitter now represents a new frontier for the study of human behavior. This research provides a framework for incorporating this emerging medium into the computational social science toolkit.

A colleague of mine and I are doing a presentation for new faculty on a number of topics related to teaching.  Our charge is to identify interesting issues and to find research-based information for them about how to approach things.  So, what I wondered is, do you know of any published research dealing with the sort of issues about structuring a course and final exam in the ways you talk about in  this blog post ?  Some poking around in the usual places hasn’t turned anything up yet.
  
I don’t really know the psychometrics literature but I imagine that some good stuff has been written on principles of test design. There are probably some good papers from back in the 1920s.  Can anyone supply some references?</p><p>2 0.97586286 <a title="544-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-14-Felix_Salmon_wins_the_American_Statistical_Association%E2%80%99s_Excellence_in_Statistical_Reporting_Award.html">33 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-14-Felix Salmon wins the American Statistical Association’s Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The official announcement:
  
The Excellence in Statistical Reporting Award for 2010 is presented to Felix Salmon for his body of work, which exemplifies the highest standards of scientific reporting. His insightful use of statistics as a tool to understanding the world of business and economics, areas that are critical in today’s economy, sets a new standard in statistical investigative reporting.
  
Here are some examples:
 
 Tiger Woods 
 
 Nigerian spammers 
 
 How the government fudges job statistics 
 
This one is important to me.  The idea is that “statistical reporting” is not just traditional science reporting (journalist talks with scientists and tries to understand the consensus) or science popularization or silly feature stories about the lottery.  Salmon is doing investigative reporting using statistical thinking.
 
Also, from a political angle, Salmon’s smart and quantitatively sophisticated work (as well as that of others such as Nate Silver) is an important counterweigh</p><p>3 0.97504544 <a title="544-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-13-Puzzles_of_criminal_justice.html">1621 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-13-Puzzles of criminal justice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Four recent news stories about crime and punishment made me realize, yet again, how little I understand all this.
 
1.   “HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Charges of Money Laundering” :
  
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world’s largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.  Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. . . .
  
I don’t understand this idea of punishing the institution.  I have the same problem when the NCAA punishes a college football program.  These are individual people breaking the law (or the rules), right?  So why not punish them directly?  Giving 40 lashes to a bunch of HSBC executives and garnisheeing their salaries for life, say, that wouldn’t destabilize the global financial system would it?  From the article:  “A money-laundering indictment, or a guilt</p><p>4 0.96846485 <a title="544-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-29-Putting_together_multinomial_discrete_regressions_by_combining_simple_logits.html">782 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-29-Putting together multinomial discrete regressions by combining simple logits</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When predicting 0/1 data we can use logit (or probit or robit or some other robust model such as invlogit (0.01 + 0.98*X*beta)).  Logit is simple enough and we can use  bayesglm  to regularize and avoid the problem of separation.
 
What if there are more than 2 categories?  If they’re ordered (1, 2, 3, etc), we can do ordered logit (and use bayespolr() to avoid separation).  If the categories are unordered (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry), there are unordered multinomial logit and probit models out there.
 
But it’s not so easy to fit these multinomial model in a multilevel setting (with coefficients that vary by group), especially if the computation is embedded in an iterative routine such as mi where you have real time constraints at each step.
 
So this got me wondering whether we could kluge it with logits.  Here’s the basic idea (in the ordered and unordered forms):
 
- If you have a variable that goes 1, 2, 3, etc., set up a series of logits:  1 vs. 2,3,…; 2 vs. 3,…; and so forth</p><p>5 0.96754551 <a title="544-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-09-02-%E2%80%9CIf_our_product_is_harmful_._._._we%E2%80%99ll_stop_making_it.%E2%80%9D.html">1480 andrew gelman stats-2012-09-02-“If our product is harmful . . . we’ll stop making it.”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After our  discussion  of the sad case of Darrell Huff, the celebrated “How to Lie with Statistics” guy who had a lucrative side career disparaging the link between smoking and cancer, I was motivated to follow John Mashey’s  recommendation  and read the book, Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition, by historian Robert Proctor.
 
My first stop upon receiving the book was the index, in particular the entry for  Rubin, Donald B.   I followed the reference to pages 440-442 and found the description of Don’s activities to be accurate, neither diminished nor overstated, to the best of my knowledge.
 
Rubin is the second-most-famous statistician to have been paid by the cigarette industry, but several other big and small names have been on the payroll at one time or another.  Here’s a partial  list .  Just including the people I know or have heard of:

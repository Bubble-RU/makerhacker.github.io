<p>Introduction: For awhile I’ve been fitting most of my multilevel models using lmer/glmer, which gives point estimates of the group-level variance parameters (maximum marginal likelihood estimate for lmer and an approximation for glmer).  I’m usually satisfied with this–sure, point estimation understates the uncertainty in model fitting, but that’s typically the least of our worries. 
 
Sometimes, though, lmer/glmer estimates group-level variances at 0 or estimates group-level correlation parameters at +/- 1.  Typically, when this happens, it’s not that we’re so sure the variance is close to zero or that the correlation is close to 1 or -1; rather, the marginal likelihood does not provide a lot of information about these parameters of the group-level error distribution.

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo sent me  this quote  from Jim Berger:
  
Too often I see people pretending to be subjectivists, and then using “weakly informative” priors that the objective Bayesian community knows are terrible and will give ridiculous answers; subjectivism is then being used as a shield to hide ignorance. . . . In my own more provocative moments, I claim that the only true subjectivists are the objective Bayesians, because they refuse to use subjectivism as a shield against criticism of sloppy pseudo-Bayesian practice.
  
This caught my attention because I’ve become more and more convinced that weakly informative priors are  the right way to go  in many different situations.  I don’t think Berger was talking about  me , though, as the above quote came from a publication in 2006, at which time I’d only started writing about weakly informative priors.
 
Going back to Berger’s  article , I see that his “weakly informative priors” remark was aimed at  this article  by Anthony O’Hagan, who w</p><p>4 0.34855571 <a title="846-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-29-More_by_Berger_and_me_on_weakly_informative_priors.html">1092 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-29-More by Berger and me on weakly informative priors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple days ago we  discussed  some remarks by Tony O’Hagan and Jim Berger on weakly informative priors.  Jim  followed up  on Deborah Mayo’s blog with this:
  
Objective Bayesian priors are often improper (i.e., have infinite total mass), but this is not a problem when they are developed correctly. But not every improper prior is satisfactory. For instance, the constant prior is known to be unsatisfactory in many situations. The ‘solution’ pseudo-Bayesians often use is to choose a constant prior over a large but bounded set (a ‘weakly informative’ prior), saying it is now proper and so all is well. This is not true; if the constant prior on the whole parameter space is bad, so will be the constant prior over the bounded set. The problem is, in part, that some people confuse proper priors with subjective priors and, having learned that true subjective priors are fine, incorrectly presume that weakly informative proper priors are fine.
  
I have a few reactions to this:

<p>Introduction: Nick Polson and James Scott  write :
  
We generalize the half-Cauchy prior for a global scale parameter to the wider class of hypergeometric inverted-beta priors. We derive expressions for posterior moments and marginal densities when these priors are used for a top-level normal variance in a Bayesian hierarchical model. Finally, we prove a result that characterizes the frequentist risk of the Bayes estimators under all priors in the class. These arguments provide an alternative, classical justification for the use of the half-Cauchy prior in Bayesian hierarchical models, complementing the arguments in Gelman (2006).
  
This makes me happy, of course.  It’s great to be validated.
 
The only think I didn’t catch is how they set the scale parameter for the half-Cauchy prior.  In my 2006 paper I frame it as a weakly informative prior and recommend that the scale be set based on actual prior knowledge.  But Polson and Scott are talking about a default choice.

Marginally specified priors for nonparametric Bayesian estimation


Prior specification for nonparametric Bayesian inference involves the difficult task of quantifying prior knowledge about a parameter of high, often infinite, dimension. Realistically, a statistician is unlikely to have informed opinions about all aspects of such a parameter, but may have real information about functionals of the parameter, such the population mean or variance. This article proposes a new framework for nonparametric Bayes inference in which the prior distribution for a possibly infinite-dimensional parameter is decomposed into two parts: an informative prior on a finite set of functionals, and a nonparametric conditional prior for the parameter given the functionals. Such priors can be easily constructed from standard nonparametric prior distributions in common use, and inherit the large support of the standard priors upon which they are based.

<p>Introduction: I’ve had a couple of email conversations in the past couple days on dependence in multivariate prior distributions.
 
 Modeling the degrees of freedom and scale parameters in the t distribution 
 
First, in our Stan group we’ve been discussing the choice of priors for the degrees-of-freedom parameter in the t distribution.  I wrote that also there’s the question of parameterization.  It does not necessarily make sense to have independent priors on the df and scale parameters.  In some sense, the meaning of the scale parameter changes with the df.
 
 Prior dependence between correlation and scale parameters in the scaled inverse-Wishart model 
 
The second case of parameterization in prior distribution arose from an email I received from Chris Chatham pointing me to  this exploration  by Matt Simpson of the scaled inverse-Wishart prior distribution for hierarchical covariance matrices.  Simpson writes:

<p>Introduction: Ryan King writes:
  
I was wondering if you have a brief comment on the state of the art for objective priors for hierarchical generalized linear models (generalized linear mixed models).  I have been working off the papers in Bayesian Analysis (2006) 1, Number 3 (Browne and Draper, Kass and Natarajan, Gelman).  There seems to have been continuous work for matching priors in linear mixed models, but GLMMs less so because of the lack of an analytic marginal likelihood for the variance components.  There are a number of additional suggestions in the literature since 2006, but little robust practical guidance.


I’m interested in both mean parameters and the variance components.  I’m almost always concerned with logistic random effect models.  I’m fascinated by the matching-priors idea of higher-order asymptotic improvements to maximum likelihood, and need to make some kind of defensible default recommendation.  Given the massive scale of the datasets (genetics …), extensive sensitivity a</p><p>2 0.97335649 <a title="846-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-25-Avoiding_boundary_estimates_using_a_prior_distribution_as_regularization.html">779 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-25-Avoiding boundary estimates using a prior distribution as regularization</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For awhile I’ve been fitting most of my multilevel models using lmer/glmer, which gives point estimates of the group-level variance parameters (maximum marginal likelihood estimate for lmer and an approximation for glmer).  I’m usually satisfied with this–sure, point estimation understates the uncertainty in model fitting, but that’s typically the least of our worries. 
 
Sometimes, though, lmer/glmer estimates group-level variances at 0 or estimates group-level correlation parameters at +/- 1.  Typically, when this happens, it’s not that we’re so sure the variance is close to zero or that the correlation is close to 1 or -1; rather, the marginal likelihood does not provide a lot of information about these parameters of the group-level error distribution.
 
I don’t want point estimates on the boundary.  I don’t want to say that the unexplained variance in some dimension is exactly zero.

<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  from David Gorski (which I found via  this  link from Joseph Delaney).
 
I don’t have anything really to add to this discussion except to note the value of this sort of anecdote in a statistics discussion.  It’s only n=1 and adds almost nothing to the literature on the effectiveness of various treatments, but a story like this can help focus one’s thoughts on the decision problems.</p><p>4 0.96295917 <a title="846-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-06-Question_27_of_my_final_exam_for_Design_and_Analysis_of_Sample_Surveys.html">1368 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-06-Question 27 of my final exam for Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 27. Which of the following problems were identified with the Burnham et al. survey of Iraq mortality? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) The survey used cluster sampling, which is inappropriate for estimating individual out- comes such as death.
 
(b) In their report, Burnham et al. did not identify their primary sampling units.
 
(c) The second-stage sampling was not a probability sample.
 
(d) Survey materials supplied by the authors are incomplete and inconsistent with published descriptions of the survey.
 
 Solution to question 26 
 
From  yesterday :
  
26. You have just graded an an exam with 28 questions and 15 students. You fit a logistic item- response model estimating ability, difficulty, and discrimination parameters. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)

<p>Introduction: 26. You have just graded an an exam with 28 questions and 15 students. You fit a logistic item- response model estimating ability, difficulty, and discrimination parameters. Which of the following statements are basically true? (Indicate all that apply.)
 
(a) If a question is answered correctly by students with very low and very high ability, but is missed by students in the middle, it will have a high value for its discrimination parameter.
 
(b) It is not possible to fit an item-response model when you have more questions than students. In order to fit the model, you either need to reduce the number of questions (for example, by discarding some questions or by putting together some questions into a combined score) or increase the number of students in the dataset.
 
(c) To keep the model identified, you can set one of the difficulty parameters or one of the ability parameters to zero and set one of the discrimination parameters to 1.

<p>Introduction: The sister blog has  moved  to the Washington Post.  It’s harder to leave comments there, so I’ll post my comments to Monkey Cage posts here instead.
 
Political scientist Lisa Martin wrote  a post  on student evaluations of teaching, based on  a recent paper  where she writes:
  
Many female faculty believe that they face prejudice in student evaluations of teaching (SETs), and that this prejudice may be exaggerated by developments such as online evaluations and the prevalence of sites such as RateMyProfessor. However, systematic studies of SETs are mixed in their findings of gender bias.
  
As a statistician, I always like to hear this sort of moderate statement.  On the blog, Martin shows the following graph based on data from the political science departments of “publicly available SET data from two large public universities, one in the South and the other on the West Coast”:
 
 
 
The graph left me with two questions and a comment:

 General advice 


Both the papers sent to me appear to have strong research results. Now that the research has been done, I’d recommend rewriting both articles from scratch, using the following template:


1. Start with the conclusions. Write a couple pages on what you’ve found and what you recommend. In writing these conclusions, you should also be writing some of the introduction, in that you’ll need to give enough background so that general readers can understand what you’re talking about and why they should care. But you want to start with the conclusions, because that will determine what sort of background information you’ll need to give.


2. Now step back. What is the principal evidence for your conclusions? Make some graphs and pull out some key numbers that represent your research findings which back up your claims.


3. Back one more step, now. What are the methods and data you used to obtain your research findings.

<p>Introduction: Columbia College has for many years had a Core Curriculum, in which students read classics such as Plato (in translation) etc.  A few years ago they created a Science core course.  There was always some confusion about this idea:  On one hand, how much would college freshmen really learn about science by reading the classic writings of Galileo, Laplace, Darwin, Einstein, etc.?  And they certainly wouldn’t get much out by puzzling over the latest issues of Nature, Cell, and Physical Review Letters.  On the other hand, what’s the point of having them read Dawkins, Gould, or even Brian Greene?  These sorts of popularizations give you a sense of modern science (even to the extent of conveying some of the debates in these fields), but reading them might not give the same intellectual engagement that you’d get from wrestling with the Bible or Shakespeare.
 
I have a different idea.  What about structuring the entire course around computer programming and simulation?

<p>Introduction: After  posting  on David Rubinstein’s remarks on his “cushy life” as a sociology professor at a public university, I read  these remarks  by some of Rubinstein’s colleagues at the University of Illinois, along with a response from Rubinstein.
 
Before getting to the policy issues, let me first say that I think it must have been so satisfying, first for Rubinstein and then for his colleagues (Barbara Risman, William Bridges, and Anthony Orum) to publish these notes.  We all have people we know and hate, but we rarely have a good excuse for blaring our feelings in public. (I remember when I was up for tenure, I was able to read the outside letters on my case (it’s a public university and they have rules), and one of the letter writers really hated my guts.  I was surprised–I didn’t know the guy well (the letters were anonymized but it was clear from context who the letter writer was) but the few times we’d met, he’d been cordial enough–but there you have it.

<p>Introduction: Bob told me the other day (the other week, actually, as I’m stacking up posts here with a roughly one-month delay) that I shouldn’t try to compete with the electrical engineers when it comes to length of C.V.:  according to Bob, these dudes can have over two  thousand  publications!
 
How do they do it?  First, an EE prof will have tons of graduate students and postdocs, they’re all writing papers and presenting at conferences,  and they all stick his name on the author list.  Second, these students and postdocs write up and publish  every experiment they do .  Including (especially!) computer experiments.
 
And . . . all these people writing paper cite each other, so they quickly rack up thousands of citations.
 
Upon hearing this, my first reaction to this was fear, plain and simple.  One of the distinguishing characteristics of my own research record is that I have so many publications and citations.  Those electrical engineers . . . how dare they go around devaluing my currency!</p><p>6 0.75606769 <a title="540-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-03-Evaluating_evidence_from_published_research.html">2006 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-03-Evaluating evidence from published research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ooooooh, I never ever thought I’d have a legitimate excuse to tell this story, and now I do!  The story took place many years ago, but first I have to tell you what made me think of it:
 
Rasmus Bååth  posted  the following comment last month:
  
On airplane tickets a Swedish “å” is written as “aa” resulting in Rasmus Baaaath. Once I bought a ticket online and five minutes later a guy from Lufthansa calls me and asks if I misspelled my name…
  
OK, now here’s my story (which is not nearly as good).  A long time ago (but when I was already an adult), I was in England for some reason, and I thought I’d take a day trip from London to Bath.  So here I am on line, trying to think of what to say at the ticket counter.  I remember that in England, they call Bath, Bahth.  So, should I ask for “a ticket to Bahth”?  I’m not sure, I’m afraid that it will sound silly, like I’m trying to fake an English accent.  So, when I get to the front of the line, I say, hesitantly, “I’d like a ticket to Bath?</p><p>2 0.95682609 <a title="540-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-17-Clutering_and_variance_components.html">417 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-17-Clutering and variance components</a></p>

Do you have any recommendations on clustering and binary models? My particular problem is I’m running a firm fixed effect logit and want to cluster by industry-year (every combination of industry-year). My control variable of interest in measured by industry-year and when I cluster by industry-year, the standard errors are 300x larger than when I don’t cluster. Strangely, this problem only occurs when doing logit and not OLS (linear probability). Also, clustering just by field doesn’t blow up the errors. My hunch is it has something to do with the non-nested structure of year, but I don’t understand why this is only problematic under logit and not OLS.
  
My reply:
 
I’d recommend including four multilevel variance parameters, one for firm, one for industry, one for year, and one for industry-year.  (In lmer, that’s (1 | firm) + (1 | industry) + (1 | year) + (1 | industry.year)).  No need to include (1 | firm.year) since in your data this is the error term.

<p>Introduction: Now that you have some free time again, you’ll have to check out  these books  and tell us if they’re worth reading.
 
Claire Kirch  reports :
  
Lizzie Skurnick Books launches in September with the release of Debutante Hill by Lois Duncan. The novel, which was originally published by Dodd, Mead, in 1958, has been out of print for about three decades.


The other books on the initial list, all reissues, are A Long Day in November by Ernest J. Gaines (originally published in 1971), Happy Endings Are All Alike by Sandra Scoppettone (1979), I’ll Love You When You’re More Like Me by M.E. Kerr (1977), Secret Lives by Berthe Amoss (1979), To All My Fans, With Love, From Sylvie by Ellen Conford (1982), and Me and Fat Glenda by Lila Perl (1972). . . .


Noting that many of the books of that era beloved by teen boys are still in print – such as Isaac Asimov’s novels and The Chocolate War by Robert Cormier – Skurnick pointed out that, in contrast, many of the books that were embraced by teen gir</p><p>4 0.95320094 <a title="540-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-09-The_pretty_picture_is_just_the_beginning_of_the_data_exploration.__But_the_pretty_picture_is_a_great_way_to_get_started.__Another_example_of_how_a_puzzle_can_make_a_graph_appealing.html">1614 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-09-The pretty picture is just the beginning of the data exploration.

Here are some of the comments on the linked page:
 
 
 
Rather than redrawing the picture to make the lines more clear, I’d say:  leave the graphic as is, and have a link to a set of statistical graphs that show where the different sorts of old trees are and what they look like.  Let’s value the above image for its clean look and its clever Christmas-tree design, and once we have it, take advantage of viewers’ interest in the topic to show them more.
 
P.S.  See my  comment  below which I think further illuminates the appeal of this particular tree.</p><p>5 0.95163524 <a title="540-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-11-Convergence_Monitoring_for_Non-Identifiable_and_Non-Parametric_Models.html">1374 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-11-Convergence Monitoring for Non-Identifiable and Non-Parametric Models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Becky Passonneau and colleagues at the Center for Computational Learning Systems (CCLS) at Columbia have been working on a project for ConEd (New York’s major electric utility) to  rank structures based on vulnerability to secondary events  (e.g., transformer explosions, cable meltdowns, electrical fires).  They’ve been using the R implementation  BayesTree  of Chipman, George and McCulloch’s  Bayesian Additive Regression Trees  (BART).
 
BART is a Bayesian non-parametric method that is non-identifiable in two ways.  Firstly, it is an additive tree model with a fixed number of trees, the indexes of which aren’t identified (you get the same predictions in a model swapping the order of the trees).  This is the same kind of non-identifiability you get with any mixture model (additive or interpolated) with an exchangeable prior on the mixture components.  Secondly, the trees themselves have varying structure over samples in terms of number of nodes and their topology (depth, branching, etc</p><p>6 0.95041931 <a title="540-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-15-n_%3D_2.html">912 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-15-n = 2</a></p>

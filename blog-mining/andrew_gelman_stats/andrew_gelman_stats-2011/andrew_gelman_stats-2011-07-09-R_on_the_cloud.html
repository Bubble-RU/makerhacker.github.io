<p>Introduction: I read  this article  by Rivka Galchen on quantum computing.  Much of the article was about an eccentric scientist in his fifties named David Deutch.  I’m sure the guy is brilliant but I wasn’t particularly interested in his not particularly interesting life story (apparently he’s thin and lives in Oxford).  There was a brief description of quantum computing itself, which reminds me of the discussion we had a couple years ago under the heading,  The laws of conditional probability are false  (and the update  here ).
 
I don’t have anything new to say here; I’d just never heard of quantum computing before and it seemed relevant to our discussion.  The uncertainty inherent in quantum computing seems closely related to Jouni’s idea of  fully Bayesian computing , that uncertainty should be inherent in the computational structure rather than tacked on at the end.
 
P.S.  No, I’m not working on July 4th!  This post is two months old, we just have a long waiting list of blog entries.</p><p>3 0.10768449 <a title="793-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-27-Big_Data%E2%80%A6Big_Deal%3F_Maybe%2C_if_Used_with_Caution..html">2307 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-27-Big Data…Big Deal?

<p>Introduction: This post is by  David K. Park  
  
 As we have witnessed, the term “big data” has been thrusted onto the zeitgeist in the past several years, however, when one pushes beyond the hype, there seems to be little substance there. We’ve always had “data” so what so unique about it this time? Yes, we recognize it’s “big” but is there anything unique about data this time around? 
  

I’ve spend some time thinking about this and the answer seems to be yes, and it falls on three dimensions:

 
 
  Capturing Conversations & Relationships : Individuals have always communicated with one another, but now we can capture some of that conversation – email, blogs, social media (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest) – and we can now do it with machines via sensors, ie “the internet of things” as we hear so much about; 
  Granularity : We can now understand individuals at a much finer level of analysis. No longer do we need to rely on a sample size of 500 people to “represent” the nation, but instead we can acc</p><p>4 0.10093004 <a title="793-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-30-Stan_uses_Nuts%21.html">1036 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-30-Stan uses Nuts!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We interrupt our usual program of  Ed Wegman   Gregg Easterbrook  Niall Ferguson mockery to deliver a serious update on our statistical computing project.
 
 Stan  (“Sampling Through Adaptive Neighborhoods”) is our new C++ program (written mostly by Bob Carpenter) that draws samples from Bayesian models.  Stan can take different sorts of inputs:  you can write the model in a Bugs-like syntax and it goes from there, or you can write the log-posterior directly as a C++ function.
 
Most of the computation is done using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  HMC requires some tuning, so Matt Hoffman up and wrote a new algorithm, Nuts (the “No-U-Turn Sampler”) which optimizes HMC adaptively.  In many settings, Nuts is actually more computationally efficient than the optimal static HMC!
 
 When the  the Nuts paper  appeared on Arxiv, Christian Robert noticed it and had  some reactions .

<p>Introduction: I’ve been getting these sorts of emails every couple days lately:
  
Respected Professor Gelman 


I am a senior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). I am currently in the 8th Semester of my Master of Science (Integrated) in Mathematics and Scientific Computing program. I went through some of your previous work and found it to be very interesting, especially ‘Discussion of the article “website morphing”‘. I am interested in working under your guidance in a full time research during this summer (May 2014 – July 2014)


I have a deep interest in Economics (especially Game Theory), Applied Mathematics and Statistics and I have consistently performed well in many courses. My past research experience convinced me of my potential for research and I am in search of an opportunity under your guidance to hone my analytic and research skills


As evident from my resume, most of my work till now hovers around analysis and application of abstract ideas, where in mos</p><p>3 0.76624382 <a title="793-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-29-More_consulting_experiences%2C_this_time_in_computational_linguistics.html">1596 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-29-More consulting experiences, this time in computational linguistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob wrote  this  long comment that I think is worth posting:
  
I [Bob] have done a fair bit of consulting for my small natural language processing  company  over the past ten years. Like statistics, natural language processing is something may companies think they want, but have no idea how to do themselves.


We almost always handed out “free” consulting. Usually on the phone to people who called us out of the blue. Our blog and tutorials Google ranking was pretty much our only approach to marketing other than occassionally going to business-oriented conferences.


Our goal was to sell software licenses (because consulting doesn’t scale nor does it provide continuing royalty income), but since so few people knew how to use toolkits like ours, we had to help them along the way. We even provided “free” consulting with our startup license package.


We were brutally honest with customers, both about our goals and their goals. Their goals were often incompatible with ours (use company X’</p><p>4 0.73631173 <a title="793-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-There_are_four_ways_to_get_fired_from_Caesars%3A__%281%29_theft%2C_%282%29_sexual_harassment%2C_%283%29_running_an_experiment_without_a_control_group%2C_and_%284%29_keeping_a_gambling_addict_away_from_the_casino.html">1619 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-There are four ways to get fired from Caesars:  (1) theft, (2) sexual harassment, (3) running an experiment without a control group, and (4) keeping a gambling addict away from the casino</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ever since I got this new sound system for my bike, I’ve been listening to a lot of podcasts.  This American Life is really good.  I know, I know, everybody knows that, but it’s true.  The only segments I don’t like are the ones that are too “writerly,” when they read a short story aloud.  They don’t work for me.  Most of the time, though, the show is as great as everyone says it is.
 
Anyway, the other day I listened to  program #466:  Blackjack .  It started with some items on card counting.  That stuff is always fun.  Then they get to the longer story, which is all about a moderately rich housewife from Iowa who, over a roughly ten-year period, lost her life savings, something like a million dollars, at Harrah’s casinos.  Did you know they had casinos in Iowa and Indiana?  I didn’t.  Anyway, the lady was a gambling addict.  That part’s pretty clear.  You don’t lose your life savings at a casino by accident.

[In a  recent study , Gilles Duranton and Matthew Turner write:]

 
For interstate highways in metropolitan areas we [Duranton and Turner] ﬁnd that VKT (vehicle kilometers traveled) increases one for one with interstate highways, conﬁrming the fundamental law of highway congestion.’
 

Provision of public transit also simply leads to the people taking public transport being replaced by drivers on the road.  Therefore:

 
These ﬁndings suggest that both road capacity expansions and extensions to public transit are not appropriate policies with which to combat trafﬁc congestion. This leaves congestion pricing as the main candidate tool to curb trafﬁc congestion.
 
  
To which I reply:  Sure,  if your goal is to curb traffic congestion .  But what sort of goal is that?  Thinking like a microeconomist, my policy goal is to increase people’s utility.

<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>2 0.97244906 <a title="793-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-14-GiveWell_charity_recommendations.html">1623 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-14-GiveWell charity recommendations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a rare Christmas-themed post here, I pass along this note from Alexander Berger at  GiveWell :
  
 We just published a  blog post  following up on the *other* famous piece of evidence for deworming, the Miguel and Kremer experiment from Kenya. They shared data and code from their working paper (!) follow-up finding that deworming increases incomes ten years later, and we came out of the re-analysis feeling more confident in, though not wholly convinced by, the results. 
 We’ve also just released  our new list of top charities  for giving season this year, which I think might be a good fit for your audience. We wrote a  blog post explaining our choices , and have also published extensive reviews of the top charities and the interventions on which they work. Perhaps the most interesting change since last year is the addition of GiveDirectly in the #2 spot; they do direct unconditional cash transfers to people living on less than a dollar a day in Kenya.

<p>Introduction: Here. 
 
And here’s the story so far: 
   
Ron Unz  posted  a long article on college admissions of Asians and Jews with some numbers and comparisons that made their way into some blogs (including  here ) and also a David Brooks NYT  column  which was read by many people, including Janet Mertz, who’d done previous research on ethnic composition of high-end math students.
 
Mertz contacted me (she’d earlier tried Brooks and others but received no helpful reply), and I  posted  her findings along with those of another correspondent.  Unz then  replied , motivating Mertz to write a seven-page  document  expanding on her earlier emails.  Unz  responded  to that, characterizing Mertz as maybe “emotional” but not actually disputing any of her figures.  Unz did, however, make the unconvincing (to me) implication that his original numbers were basically OK even in light of Mertz’s corrections.  So Mertz responded  once more .

<p>Introduction: Just as scientists should never really have to think much about statistics, I feel that, in an ideal world, statisticians would never have to worry about computing.  In the real world, though, we have to spend a lot of time building our own tools.
 
It would be great if we could routinely run R with speed and memory limitations being less of a concern.  One suggestion that sometimes arises is to run things on “the cloud.”  So I was interested upon receiving this email from Niklas Frassa:
  
 
Time intensive calculations, as known from life science, finance or business intelligence, can now be processed at a whole new level of speed – in the Cloud. cloudnumbers.com provides an intuitive platform that enables everyone to run time consuming calculations on clusters with more than 1000 CPUs.


So far, High Performance Computing has only been accessible for large corporations and universities leading to significant competitive disadvantages for small and medium-sized companies.

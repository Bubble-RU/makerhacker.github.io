I thought I had read on your blog that bar charts should always include zero on the scale, but a search of your blog (or google) didn’t return what I was looking for.  Is it considered a best practice to always include zero on the axis for bar charts?  Has this been written in a book?
  
My reply:
 
The idea is that the area of the bar represents “how many” or “how much.” The bar has to go down to 0 for that to work.  You don’t have to have your y-axis go to zero, but if you want the axis to go anywhere else, don’t use a bar graph, use a line graph.  Usually line graphs are better anyway.
 
I’m sure this is all in a book somewhere.</p><p>3 0.15018746 <a title="1061-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-11-Note_to_semi-spammers.html">199 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-11-Note to semi-spammers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just deleted another comment that seemed reasonable but was attached to an advertisement.
 
Here’s a note to all of you advertisers out there:  If you want to leave a comment on this site, please do so  without  the link to your website on search engine optimization or whatever.  Or else it will get deleted.  Which means you were wasting your time in writing the comment.
 
I want your comments and I don’t want you to waste your time.  So please just stop already with the links, and we’ll both be happier.

<p>Introduction: I received the following email, subject line “Want to Buy Text Link from andrewgelman.com”: 
  
  
Dear,


I am Mary Taylor. I have started a link building campaign for my growing websites. For this, I need your cooperation. The campaign is quite diverse and large scale and if you take some time to understand it – it will benefit us.


First I want to clarify that I do not want “blogroll” ”footer” or any other type of “site wide links”.


Secondly I want links from inner pages of site – with good page rank of course.


Third links should be within text so that Google may not mark them as spam – not for you and not for me.


Hence this link building will cause almost no harm to your site or me. Because content links are fine with Google.


Now I should come to the requirements. I will accept links from Page Rank 3 to as high as you have got. Also kindly note that I can buy 1 to 50 links from one site – so you should understand the scale of the project. If you have multiple sites with co</p><p>3 0.71433991 <a title="1061-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-21-Least_surprising_headline_of_the_year.html">919 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-21-Least surprising headline of the year</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following (unsolicited) email:  
  
Howdy Andrew,


Hope you’re keeping well! I was wondering if you’re open to guest posts at Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science – if you are interested, I can offer an original 500-1000 word, very high quality article in fitting with the site. All research and writing will be carried out by a professional writer (namely, me) and once approved it will be entirely yours to place on the site as you see fit.


I can choose a title for the article or you can suggest one and I’ll work around that. Normally I write for property and travel sites (particularly cruise and ski related), but I’m game for anything if you’re happy to entertain me. I can also include some copyright-free and high quality pictures related to the blog post.


You’re probably wondering what’s in it for me, which is a fair question – in return, all I’d ask is a subtle link back in return. Other than that, the material itself would be non-commericial</p><p>6 0.65711945 <a title="1061-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-11-Note_to_semi-spammers.html">199 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-11-Note to semi-spammers</a></p>

I [Rogers] am a member of an online community of statisticians where I burn a great deal of time (and a recovering cog sci researcher). Our community website is a peer-reviewed Q and A spanning stats topics ranging from applications to mathematical theory. Our online community consists of mostly university faculty, grad students and technical consultants. The answer quality is very strong and the web design is intuitive. I think you and your readers are like-minded and would be really interested in some of the topics on the site,  CrossValidated  (you may know the sister site:  stackoverflow.com ). The philosophy is purely to further knowledge for the sake of knowledge and take pride in learning.
  
I took a quick look and the site seemed like it could be useful to people.  The only thing I didn’t understand is, why doesn’t it have a search function?  (Or maybe it was there somewhere and I couldn’t find it.)

<p>Introduction: This  is hilarious ( link  from a completely deadpan Tyler Cowen).  I’d call it “unintentionally hilarious” but I’m pretty sure that rms knew this was funny when he was writing it.  It’s sort of like when you write a  top 10  list—it’s hard to resist getting silly and going over the top.  It’s only near the end that we get to the bit about the parrots.
 
All joking aside, the most interesting part of the email was this:
  
I [rms] have to spend 6 to 8 hours *every day* doing my usual work, which is responding to email about the GNU Project and the Free Software Movement.
  
I’d wondered for awhile what is it that Richard Stallman actually does, that is how does he spend his time (aside from giving lectures to promote his ideas and pay the bills).
 
 Emailing –> Blogging

<p>Introduction: Trey Causey  asks , Has R-help gotten meaner over time?:
  

I began by using Scrapy to download all the e-mails sent to R-help between April 1997 (the earliest available archive) and December 2012. . . .


 


We each read 500 messages and coded them in the following categories:


-2 Negative and unhelpful 
-1 Negative but helpful 
0 No obviously valence or request for additional information 
1 Positive or helpful 
2 Not a response 
An example of a response coded -2 would be responses that do not answer the question, along with simply telling the user to RTFM, that they have violated the posting guidelines, or offer “?lm” as the only text when the question is about lm(). . . .


Proportions of emails in each category in the test set were estimated on a monthly basis. Much to my surprise, R-help appears to be getting less mean over time! The proportion of “negative and unhelpful” messages has fallen steadily over time, from a high of 0.20 in October of 1997 to a low of 0.015 in January</p><p>4 0.95831692 <a title="1061-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-29-The_mystery_of_the_U-shaped_relationship_between_happiness_and_age.html">437 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-29-The mystery of the U-shaped relationship between happiness and age</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For  awhile  I’ve been curious (see also  here ) about the U-shaped relation between happiness and age (with people least happy, on average, in their forties, and happier before and after).
 
But when I tried to demonstrate it to me intro statistics course, using the General Social Survey, I couldn’t find the famed U, or anything like it.  Using pooled GSS data mixes age, period, and cohort, so I tried throwing in some cohort effects (indicators for decades) and a couple other variables, but still couldn’t find that U.
 
So I was intrigued when I came across  this paper by Paul Frijters and Tony Beatton , who write:
  
Whilst the majority of psychologists have concluded there is not much of a relationship at all, the economic literature has unearthed a possible U-shape relationship. In this paper we [Frijters and Beatton] replicate the U-shape for the German SocioEconomic Panel (GSOEP), and we investigate several possible explanations for it.
  
They write:
  
What is the relationship</p><p>5 0.95705253 <a title="1061-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-13-An_Economist%E2%80%99s_Guide_to_Visualizing_Data.html">2246 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-13-An Economist’s Guide to Visualizing Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stephen Jenkins wrote:
  
I was thinking that you and your blog readers might be interested in “ An Economist’s Guide to Visualizing Data ” by Jonathan Schwabish, in the most recent Journal of Economic Perspectives (which is the American Economic Association’s main “outreach” journal in some ways).
  
I replied:
  
Ooh, I hate this so much!  This seems to represent a horrible example of economists not recognizing that outsiders can help them.  We do much much better in political science.
  
To which Jenkins wrote:
  
Ha! I guessed as much — hence sent it. And I’ll now admit I was surprised that JEP took the piece without getting Schwabisch to widen his reference points.
  
To elaborate a bit:  I agree with Schwabish’s general advice (“show the data,” “reduce the clutter,” and “integrate the text and the graph”).  But then he illustrates with 8 before-and-after stories in which he shows an existing graph and then gives his improvements.

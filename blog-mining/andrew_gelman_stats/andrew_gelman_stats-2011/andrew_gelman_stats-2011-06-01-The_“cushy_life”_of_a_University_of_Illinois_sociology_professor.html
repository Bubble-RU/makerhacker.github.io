<br/><h2>meta infos for this blog</h2><p>Source: <a title="andrew_gelman_stats-2011-740-html" href="http://andrewgelman.com/2011/06/01/the_cushy_life/">html</a></p><p>Introduction: Xian points me to  an article  by retired college professor David Rubinstein who argues that college professors are underworked and overpaid:
  
After 34 years of teaching sociology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I [Rubinstein] recently retired at age 64 at 80 percent of my pay for life. . . . But that’s not all: There’s a generous health insurance plan, a guaranteed 3 percent annual cost of living increase, and a few other perquisites. . . . I was also offered the opportunity to teach as an emeritus for three years, receiving $8,000 per course . . . which works out to over $200 an hour. . . .
  
You will perhaps not be surprised to hear that I had two immediate and opposite reactions to this:
 
1.  Hey–somebody wants to cut professors’ salaries.  Stop him!
 
2.  Hey–this guy’s making big bucks and doesn’t do any work–that’s not fair!  (I  went online  to find David Rubinstein’s salary but it didn’t appear in the database.

[sent-22, score-0.448]
</p><p>2 That really is higher than I expected, given that (a) sociology does not have a reputation as being a high-paying field, and (b) UIC is OK but it’s not generally considered a top university. [sent-24, score-0.297]
</p><p>3 Rubinstein’s planning to spend only 40 hours teaching a course? [sent-28, score-0.346]
</p><p>4 I’m assuming it’s a 1-semester course, if it’s 13 weeks at 3 classroom hours per week, that’s 39 hours already. [sent-29, score-0.557]
</p><p>5 So he’s planning to spend 1 hour during the entire semester for class preparation, meetings with students, grading papers, and everything else. [sent-30, score-0.422]
</p><p>6 The only really arduous part of teaching was grading exams and papers. [sent-34, score-0.282]
</p><p>7 He says he still spent less than 40 hours total per semester, so this means he spent less than 1 hour per week on class preparation, office hours, and all other work required for the course. [sent-40, score-0.795]
</p><p>8 Too cushy and too well-paid    Rubinstein’s fundamental criticism of the system, though, is not that he’s a slacker but that the college-professor job is too good. [sent-42, score-0.303]
</p><p>9 Some jobs are easy and some jobs are well-paid but it seems wrong for a job to be both. [sent-43, score-0.273]
</p><p>10 And a bit of evidence in favor of the “prof jobs are too cushy” argument is that nobody ever seems to quit:    In my 34 years, just one professor in the sociology department resigned to take a nonacademic job. [sent-44, score-0.282]
</p><p>11 The rarity of quits and the abundance of applications is good evidence that the life of the college professor is indeed enviable. [sent-46, score-0.296]
</p><p>12 Rubinstein writes as if it’s surprising and wrong that high pay, good benefits, generous retirement, job security, and an easy workload go together. [sent-48, score-0.321]
</p><p>13 Princeton and Stanford aside, college towns tend to be not too expensive to life in, and you’re implicitly comparing your living standards to students. [sent-52, score-0.344]
</p><p>14 The life of the college processor is indeed enviable (even though I don’t really envy Rubinstein’s own work life, as he seems to have focused too much on reducing his workload rather than on actually enjoying his job). [sent-55, score-0.305]
</p><p>15 Profs traditionally got summers off and flexible hours but low salaries, then when money flowed into the system, salaries went up. [sent-57, score-0.369]
</p><p>16 The system has a lot of inertia:  except in exceptional economic times, you never seem to hear of professors getting salary cuts, even if they’ve been sitting around doing nothing for 20 years. [sent-58, score-0.321]
</p><p>17 )    His basic argument, I think, is that it would be ok for universities to save some money and pay their faculty less (either in salary or in reduced benefits). [sent-69, score-0.455]
</p><p>18 university system is decentralized, so if one university decides to cut back and not compete for the best faculty, it will lose in reputation, have more difficulty getting top students, etc. [sent-72, score-0.48]
</p><p>19 It’s certainly possible:  we all know how tenure-track faculty are being replaced with adjuncts, and in Europe even many tenured faculty at top universities have salaries and working conditions that are much worse than even low-ranked universities in the United States.

</p><p>20 at a time where they were giving out tenure-track slots like candy canes at Christmas, he (by his own admission) spends a total of less than one hour per week on class preparation, grading, and advising combined, and he got a contract in an era with generous retirement benefits.

The Priceonomics blog is doing a feature where we ask a few economists what they think of the the institution of tenure. If you’d be interested in participating, I’d love to get your response.


As an economist, what do you think of tenure? Should it be abolished / kept / modified?
  
My reply:  Just to be clear, I’m assuming that when you say “tenure,” you’re talking about lifetime employment for college professors such as myself.
 
I’m actually a political scientist, not an economist.  So rather than giving my opinion, I’ll say what I think an economist might say.
 
I think an economist could say one of two things:
 
Economist as anthropologist would say:  Tenure is decided by independent institutions acting freely.  If they choose to offer tenure, they will have good reasons, and it is not part of an economist’s job to second-guess individual decisions.
 
Economist as McKinsey consultant would say: Tenure can be evaluated based on a cost-benefit analysis.

<p>Introduction: David Brooks  writes : 
  
  
There’s an atmosphere of grand fragility hanging over America’s colleges. The grandeur comes from the surging application rates, the international renown, the fancy new dining and athletic facilities. The fragility comes from the fact that colleges are charging more money, but it’s not clear how much actual benefit they are providing. . . .


This is an unstable situation. At some point, parents are going to decide that $160,000 is too high a price if all you get is an empty credential and a fancy car-window sticker.


One part of the solution is found in three little words: value-added assessments. Colleges have to test more to find out how they’re doing.
  
I agree with that last paragraph.  Eric Loken and I  said  as much in the context of statistics teaching, but the principle of measuring outcomes makes sense more generally.  (Issues of measurement and evaluation are particularly salient to statisticians, given that we strongly recommend formal quanti</p><p>5 0.11631091 <a title="740-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-21-Tenure-track_statistics_job_at_Teachers_College%2C_here_at_Columbia%21.html">361 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-21-Tenure-track statistics job at Teachers College, here at Columbia!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: See below for the job announcement.  It’s for Teachers College, which is about 2 blocks from the statistics department and 2 blocks from the political science department.  So even though I don’t have any official connection with Teachers College (besides occasionally working with them on research projects), I very much would like to have another exciting young applied researcher here, to complement all the people we currently have in stat, poli sci, engineering, etc.  In particular, we have zillions of interesting and important social science research projects going on here, and they all need statistics work.  A lot of social scientists do statistics, but it’s not so easy to find a statistician who does serious social science research.
 
All this is to say that I hope this job gets some applicants from some people who are serious about applied statistics and the development of new models and methods.

<p>Introduction: Timothy Noah  reports :
  
At the end of 2007, Harvard announced that it would limit tuition to no more than 10 percent of family income for families earning up to $180,000. (It also eliminated all loans, following a trail blazed by Princeton, and stopped including home equity in its calculations of family wealth.) Yale saw and raised to $200,000, and other wealthy colleges weighed in with variations.
  
Noah argues that this is a bad thing because it encourages other colleges to give tuition breaks to families with six-figure incomes, thus sucking up money that could otherwise go to reduce tuition for lower-income students.  For example:
  
Roger Lehecka, a former dean of students at Columbia, and Andrew Delbanco, director of American studies there, wrote in the New York Times that Harvard’s initiative was “good news for students at Harvard or Yale” but “bad news” for everyone else. “The problem,” they explained, “is that most colleges will feel compelled to follow Harvard and Yale’s</p><p>4 0.81160194 <a title="740-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-26-Tenure_lets_you_handle_students_who_cheat.html">1028 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-26-Tenure lets you handle students who cheat</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend of mine who is an untenured professor (not in statistics or political science) was telling me about a class where many of the students seemed to be resubmitting papers that they had already written for previous classes.  (The supposition was based on internal evidence of the topics of the submitted papers.)  It would be possible to check this and then kick the cheating students out of the program—but why do it?  It would be a lot of work, also some of the students who are caught might complain, then word would get around that my friend is a troublemaker.  And nobody likes a troublemaker.
 
Once my friend has tenure it would be possible to do the right thing.  But . . . here’s the hitch:  most college instructors do  not  have tenure, and one result, I suspect, is a decline in ethical standards.
 
This is something I hadn’t thought of in our  earlier discussion  of job security for teachers:  tenure gives you the freedom to kick out cheating students.</p><p>5 0.80861425 <a title="740-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-17-Credentialism%2C_elite_employment%2C_and_career_aspirations.html">578 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-17-Credentialism, elite employment, and career aspirations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Hsu has posted a series of reflections  here ,  here , and  here  on the dominance of graduates of HYPS (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford (in that order, I believe)) in various Master-of-the-Universe-type jobs at “elite law firms, consultancies, and I-banks, hedge/venture funds, startups, and technology companies.”  Hsu writes:
  
In the real world, people believe in folk notions of brainpower or IQ. (“Quick on the uptake”, “Picks things up really fast”, “A sponge” …) They count on elite educational institutions to do their g-filtering for them. . . .


Most top firms only recruit at a few schools. A kid from a non-elite UG school has very little chance of finding a job at one of these places unless they first go to grad school at, e.g., HBS, HLS, or get a PhD from a top place.

<p>Introduction: Xian points me to  an article  by retired college professor David Rubinstein who argues that college professors are underworked and overpaid:
  
After 34 years of teaching sociology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I [Rubinstein] recently retired at age 64 at 80 percent of my pay for life. . . . But that’s not all: There’s a generous health insurance plan, a guaranteed 3 percent annual cost of living increase, and a few other perquisites. . . . I was also offered the opportunity to teach as an emeritus for three years, receiving $8,000 per course . . . which works out to over $200 an hour. . . .
  
You will perhaps not be surprised to hear that I had two immediate and opposite reactions to this:
 
1.  Hey–somebody wants to cut professors’ salaries.  Stop him!
 
2.  Hey–this guy’s making big bucks and doesn’t do any work–that’s not fair!  (I  went online  to find David Rubinstein’s salary but it didn’t appear in the database.  So I did the next best thing and looked up the sala</p><p>2 0.99749762 <a title="740-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-23-Christakis_response_to_my_comment_on_his_comments_on_social_science_%28or_just_skip_to_the_P.P.P.S._at_the_end%29.html">1952 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-23-Christakis response to my comment on his comments on social science (or just skip to the P.P.P.S. at the end)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, Nicholas Christakis  wrote  an article in the newspaper criticizing academic social science departments:
  
The social sciences have stagnated. . . . This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . . I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class. There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics. And repeatedly observing these phenomena does not help us fix them.
  
I  disagreed , saying that Christakis wasn’t giving social science research enough credit:
  
I’m no economist so I can let others discuss the bit about “monopoly power is bad for markets.” I assume that the study by</p><p>3 0.99638921 <a title="740-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-10-Christakis-Fowler_update.html">756 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-10-Christakis-Fowler update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After I  posted on  Russ Lyons’s criticisms of the work of Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler’s work on social networks, several people emailed in with links to related articles.  (Nobody wants to comment on the blog anymore; all I get is emails.)
 
Here they are:
  

 
Political scientists Hans Noel and Brendan Nyhan wrote  a paper  called “The ‘Unfriending’ Problem: The Consequences of Homophily in Friendship Retention for Causal Estimates of Social Influence” in which they argue that the Christakis-Fowler results are subject to bias because of patterns in the time course of friendships.
 
Statisticians Cosma Shalizi and AT wrote  a paper  called “Homophily and Contagion Are Generically Confounded in Observational Social Network Studies” arguing that analyses such as those of Christakis and Fowler cannot hope to disentangle different sorts of network effects.
 
And Christakis and Fowler reply to Noel and Nyhan, Shalizi and Thomas, Lyons, and others in  an article  that begins:

<p>Introduction: I. State of the Climate report   
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently released their  “State of the Climate Report” for 2009 .  The report has chapters discussing global climate (temperatures, water vapor, cloudiness, alpine glaciers,…); oceans (ocean heat content, sea level, sea surface temperatures, etc.); the arctic (sea ice extent, permafrost, vegetation, and so on); Antarctica (weather observations, sea ice extent,…), and regional climates. 
 
NOAA also provides  a nice page  that lets you display any of 11 relevant time-series datasets (land-surface air temperature, sea level, ocean heat content, September arctic sea-ice extent, sea-surface temperature, northern hemisphere snow cover, specific humidity, glacier mass balance, marine air temperature, tropospheric temperature, and stratospheric temperature).  Each of the plots overlays data from several databases (not necessarily indepenedent of each other), and you can select which ones to include or leave</p><p>5 0.99552554 <a title="740-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-01-Looking_for_a_textbook_for_a_two-semester_course_in_probability_and_%28theoretical%29_statistics.html">596 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-01-Looking for a textbook for a two-semester course in probability and (theoretical) statistics</a></p>

I am in the process of choosing a textbook for a junior- or senior-level undergraduate two-semester sequence in probability and statistics.


I would be obliged if you could recommend one which is free (or at least cheap), or inquire with your blog readers for such a recommendation.


The course has been taught successfully in the past using Mathematical Statistics with Applications, by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer. Also at roughly the right level is Probability and Statistics by deGroot and Schervish.  However, the current edition of the first text now lists for $217, and I find myself embarrassed to ask students at a public university to pay prices at this level.


The main item on my wish list, other than the textbook being cheap and at the right level, is that it should be possible to teach the course by following the book closely for the entire year.

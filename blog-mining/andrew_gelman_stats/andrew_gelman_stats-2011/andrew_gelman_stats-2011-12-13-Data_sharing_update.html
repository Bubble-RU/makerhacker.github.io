Disclosing information, thoughts, and feelings about personal and meaningful topics (experimental disclosure) is purported to have various health and psychological consequences (e.g., J. W.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Perrin  nails it :
  
Twice a year, like clockwork, the ethics cops at the IRB [institutional review board, the group on campus that has to approve research involving human subjects] take a break from deciding whether or not radioactive isotopes can be administered to prison populations to cure restless-leg syndrome to dream up some fancy new way in which participating in an automated telephone poll might cause harm.
  
Perrin adds:
  
The list of exemptions to IRB review is too short and, more importantly, contains no guiding principle as to what makes exempt. . . . [and] Even exemptions require approval by the IRB.
  
He also voices a thought I’ve had many times, which is that there are all sorts of things you or I or anyone else can do on the street (for example, go up to people and ask them personal questions, drop objects and see if people pick them up, stage fights with our friends to see the reactions of bystanders, etc etc etc) but for which we have to go through an IRB</p><p>4 0.268534 <a title="1055-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-16-Another_update_on_the_spam_email_study.html">35 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-16-Another update on the spam email study</a></p>

Akinola Modupe and Katherine Milkman responded to  my email  about  their study :
  
We want to clarify the reason we believe that the use of deception and a lack of informed consent were appropriate and ethical for this research study. In this project, we were studying how the timing of a decision affects discrimination based on race and/or gender.  The emails all participants in our study received were identical except for a) the sender’s name (we used 20 names that pretesting revealed were strongly associated with being either Caucasian, Black, Indian, Chinese or Hispanic, as well as associated with being male or female) and b) whether the meeting requested was for today or for a week from today.  Recipients were randomly selected and were randomly assigned to one of the race/gender/timing conditions.

<p>Introduction: As someone who relies strongly on survey research, it’s good for me to be reminded that some surveys are useful, some are useless, but one thing they almost all have in common is . . . they waste the respondents’ time.
 
I thought of this after receiving the following email, which I shall reproduce here.  My own comments appear after.
     
Recently, you received an email from a student asking for 10 minutes of your time to discuss your Ph.D. program (the body of the email appears below). We are emailing you today to debrief you on the actual purpose of that email, as it was part of a research study. We sincerely hope our study did not cause you any disruption and we apologize if you were at all inconvenienced. Our hope is that this letter will provide a sufficient explanation of the purpose and design of our study to alleviate any concerns you may have about your involvement.

<p>Introduction: Dan Kahan  writes :
  
The basic idea . . . is to promote identification of study designs that scholars who disagree about a proposition would agree would generate evidence relevant to their competing conjectures—regardless of what studies based on such designs actually find. Articles proposing designs of this sort would be selected for publication and only then be carried out, by the proposing researchers with funding from the journal, which would publish the results too.


Now I [Kahan] am aware of a set of real journals that have a similar motivation.


One is the  Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis, which as its title implies publishes papers reporting studies that fail to “reject” the null. Like JASNH, LR ≠1J would try to offset the “file drawer” bias and like bad consequences associated with the convention of publishing only findings that are “significant at p < 0.05."


But it would try to do more.

<p>Introduction: Dylan Small writes:
  
I am starting an  observational studies journal  that aims to publish papers on all aspects of observational studies, including study protocols for observational studies, methodologies for observational studies, descriptions of data sets for observational studies, software for observational studies and analyses of observational studies.  One of the goals of the journal is to promote the planning of observational studies and to publish study plans for observational studies, like study plans are published for major clinical trials.
  
Regular readers will know my suggestion that scientific journals move away from the idea of being unique publishers of new material and move toward a “newsletter” approach, recommending papers from Arxiv, SSRN, etc.  So, instead of going through exhausting review and revision processes, the journal editors would read and review recent preprints on observational studies and then, each month or quarter or whatever, produce a list of pap</p><p>4 0.76971281 <a title="1055-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-04-22-Ticket_to_Baaaaarf.html">2301 andrew gelman stats-2014-04-22-Ticket to Baaaaarf</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A link from the comments here took me to the wonderfully named  Barfblog  and a report by Don Schaffner on some reporting.
 
 First, the background:   A university in England issued a press release saying that “Food picked up just a few seconds after being dropped is less likely to contain bacteria than if it is left for longer periods of time . . . The findings suggest there may be some scientific basis to the ‘5 second rule’  – the urban myth about it being fine to eat food that has only had contact with the floor for five seconds or less. Although people have long followed the 5 second rule, until now it was unclear whether it actually helped.”  According to the press release, the study was “undertaken by final year Biology students” and led by a professor of microbiology.
 
The press release hit the big time, hitting NPR, Slate, Forbes, the Daily News, etc etc.  Some typical headlines:

Media, web design, and marketing have all created an environment where stakeholders – clients, program participants, funders – all expect high quality graphics and reporting that effectively conveys the valuable insights from evaluation work. Some in statistics and mathematics have used data visualization strategies to support more useful reporting of complex ideas. Global growing interest in improving communications has begun to take root in the evaluation field as well. But as anyone who has sat through a day’s worth of a conference or had to endure a dissertation-worthy evaluation report knows, evaluators still have a long way to go. To support the development of researchers and evaluators, some members of the American Evaluation Association are proposing a new TIG (Topical Interest Group) on Data Visualization and Reporting.  If you are a member of AEA (or want to be) and you are interested in joining this TIG,  contact  Stephanie Evergreen.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89565647 <a title="1055-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-13-Data_sharing_update.html">1055 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-13-Data sharing update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fred Oswald reports that Sian Beilock sent him sufficient amounts of raw data from  her research study  so allow him to answer his questions about the large effects that were observed.  This sort of collegiality is central to the collective scientific enterprise.
 
The bad news is that IRB’s are still getting in the way.  Beilock was very helpful but she had to work within the constraints of her IRB, which apparently advised her not to share data—even if de-identified—without getting lots more permissions.
 
Oswald writes:
  
It is a little concerning that the IRB bars the sharing of de-identified data, particularly in light of the  specific guidelines  of the journal Science, which appears to say that when you submit a study to the journal for publication, you are allowing for the sharing of de-identified data — unless you expressly say otherwise at the point that you submit the paper for consideration.

<p>Introduction: Adam Marcus at Retraction Watch  reports  on a physicist at the University of Toronto who had this unfortunate thing happen to him:
  
This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and first and corresponding author.


The article was largely a duplication of a paper that had already appeared in ACS Nano, 4 (2010) 3374–3380, http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn100335g.


The first and the corresponding authors (Kramer and Sargent) would like to apologize for this administrative error on their part . . .
  
“Administrative error” . . . I love that!  Is that what the robber says when he knocks over a liquor store and gets caught?  As Marcus points out, the two papers have different titles and a different order of authors, which makes it less plausible that this was an administrative mistake (as could happen, for example, if a secretary was given a list of journals to submit the paper to, and accidentally submitted it to the second journal on the list without realizing it</p><p>4 0.84513271 <a title="1055-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-%E2%80%9CRewarding_Strivers%3A__Helping_Low-Income_Students_Succeed_in_College%E2%80%9D.html">95 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-“Rewarding Strivers:  Helping Low-Income Students Succeed in College”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several years ago, I heard about a project at the Educational Testing Service to  identify “strivers”:  students from disadvantaged backgrounds who did unexpectedly well on the SAT (the college admissions exam formerly known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” but apparently now just “the SAT,” in the same way that Exxon is just “Exxon” and that Harry Truman’s middle name is just “S”), at least 200 points above a predicted score based on demographic and neighborhood information.  My ETS colleague and I agreed that this was a silly idea:  From a statistical point of view, if student A is expected ahead of time to do better than student B, and then they get identical test scores, then you’d expect student A (the non-”striver”) to do better than student B (the “striver”) later on.  Just basic statistics:  if a student does much better than expected, then probably some of that improvement is noise.  The idea of identifying these “strivers” seemed misguided and not the best use of the SAT.</p><p>5 0.84163761 <a title="1055-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-27-%E2%80%9CHow_to_Lie_with_Statistics%E2%80%9D_guy_worked_for_the_tobacco_industry_to_mock_studies_of_the_risks_of_smoking_statistics.html">1285 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-27-“How to Lie with Statistics” guy worked for the tobacco industry to mock studies of the risks of smoking statistics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Remember How to Lie With Statistics?  It turns out that the author worked for the cigarette companies.  John Mashey  points  to this, from Robert Proctor’s book, “Golden Holocaust: Origins of the Cigarette Catastrophe and the Case for Abolition”:
  
Darrell Huff, author of the wildly popular (and aptly named) How to Lie With Statistics, was paid to testify before Congress in the 1950s and then again in the 1960s, with the assigned task of ridiculing any notion of a cigarette-disease link. On March 22, 1965, Huff testified at hearings on cigarette labeling and advertising, accusing the recent Surgeon General’s report of myriad failures and “fallacies.” Huff peppered his attack with with amusing asides and anecdotes, lampooning spurious correlations like that between the size of Dutch families and the number of storks nesting on rooftops–which proves not that storks bring babies but rather that people with large families tend to have larger houses (which therefore attract more storks).</p><p>6 0.82561082 <a title="1055-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-10-Presenting_at_the_econ_seminar.html">1050 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-10-Presenting at the econ seminar</a></p>

</p><p>3 My [McGovern's] aim in this essay is not to demolish Collier’s important work, nor to call into question development economics or the use of statistics. [sent-18, score-0.16]
</p><p>4 Now to the statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science. [sent-28, score-0.179]
</p><p>5 McGovern writes of Collier (and other quantitatively-minded researchers):    Portions of the two books draw on Collier’s academic articles to show one or several intriguing correlations. [sent-29, score-0.171]
</p><p>6 This pattern (of which McGovern gives several convincing examples) is what statistician Kaiser Fung calls  story time –that pivot from the quantitative finding to the speculative explanation  My favorite recent example remains the  recent claim  that “a raise won’t make you work harder. [sent-39, score-0.404]
</p><p>7 ”  As with McGovern’s example, the “story time” hypothesis there may very well be true (under some circumstances) but the statistical evidence doesn’t come close to proving the claim or even convincing me of its basic truth. [sent-40, score-0.256]

</p><p>9 On one hand, there are real questions to be answered and real decisions to be made in development economics (and elsewhere), and researchers and policymakers can’t simply sit still and say they can’t do anything because the data aren’t fully persuasive. [sent-42, score-0.216]
</p><p>10 )   From the other direction, once you have an interesting quantitative finding,  of course  you want to understand it, and it makes sense to use all your storytelling skills here. [sent-44, score-0.184]
</p><p>11 The question is:  How do quantitative analysis and story time fit into the big picture? [sent-48, score-0.305]
</p><p>12 I agree completely with McGovern–and I endeavor to follow this sort of modesty in presenting the implications of my own applied work–and I think it’s a starting point for Coliier and others. [sent-50, score-0.161]
</p><p>13 Once they recognize that, indeed, they are in story time, they can think harder about the empirical implications of their stories. [sent-51, score-0.178]
</p><p>14 The trap of “identifiability”    As Ole Rogeberg  writes  (following up on ideas of James Heckman and others), the search for clean identification strategies in social research can be a trap, in that it can result in precise but irrelevant findings tied to broad but unsupported claims. [sent-52, score-0.223]
</p><p>15 This has  implications  about political campaigns–and no causal identification strategy was needed. [sent-58, score-0.238]
</p><p>16 Countries with United Nations peacekeeping take longer, on average, to revert to civil war, compared to similarly-situated countries without peacekeeping. [sent-59, score-0.247]
</p><p>17 For example, there was  this claim  that warming increases the risk of civil war in Africa. [sent-63, score-0.187]
</p><p>18 I generally agree with what Chris writes, but here I think he’s a bit off by taking statistical evidence and throwing it in the same category as economic theory and models. [sent-71, score-0.254]
</p><p>19 is fine; the problem is with the economic models which are used to extrapolate from the evidence to the policy recommendations. [sent-73, score-0.272]
</p><p>20 I’m sure Chris is right that economic models can be useful in forming and testing statistical hypotheses, but I think the evidence can commonly be assessed on its own terms. [sent-74, score-0.331]

<p>Introduction: Robert Bloomfield writes:
  
Most of the people in my field (accounting, which is basically applied economics and finance, leavened with psychology and organizational behavior) use ‘positive research methods’, which are typically described as coming to the data with a predefined theory, and using hypothesis testing to accept or reject the theory’s predictions.  But a substantial minority use ‘interpretive research methods’ (sometimes called qualitative methods, for those that call positive research ‘quantitative’).  No one seems entirely happy with the definition of this method, but I’ve found it useful to think of it as an attempt to see the world through the eyes of your subjects, much as Jane Goodall lived with gorillas and tried to see the world through their eyes.)


Interpretive researchers often criticize positive researchers by noting that the latter don’t make the best use of their data, because they come to the data with a predetermined theory, and only test a narrow set of h</p><p>3 0.1038425 <a title="789-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-10-Controversy_over_the_Christakis-Fowler_findings_on_the_contagion_of_obesity.html">757 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-10-Controversy over the Christakis-Fowler findings on the contagion of obesity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler are famous for finding that obesity is contagious.  Their claims, which have been received with both respect and skepticism (perhaps we need a new word for this:  “respecticism”?) are based on analysis of data from the Framingham heart study, a large longitudinal public-health study that happened to have some social network data (for the odd reason that each participant was asked to provide the name of a friend who could help the researchers locate them if they were to move away during the study period.
 
The short story is that if your close contact became obese, you were likely to become obese also.  The long story is a debate about the reliability of this finding (that is, can it be explained by measurement error and sampling variability) and its causal implications.
 
This sort of study is in my wheelhouse, as it were, but I have never looked at the Christakis-Fowler work in detail.

<p>Introduction: This  amusing-yet-so-true video directed by Eléonore Pourriat shows a sex-role-reversed world where women are in charge and men don’t get taken seriously.  It’s convincing and affecting, but the twist that interests me comes at the end, when the real world returns.  It’s really creepy.
 
And this in turn reminds me of something we discussed here several years ago, the idea that alternative histories are made particularly compelling when they are grounded in the fact that the alternate world is not the real world.  Pourriat’s video would have been excellent even without its final scene, but that scene drives the point home in a way that I don’t think would’ve been possible had the video stayed entirely within its artificial world.
 
The point here is that the real world is indeed what is real.  This alternative sex-role-reversed world is not actually possible, and what makes it interesting to think about is the contrast to what really is.

<p>Introduction: Aaron Edlin points me to  this  issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives that focuses on statistical methods for causal inference in economics.  (Michael Bishop’s page provides  some links .)
 
To quickly summarize my reactions to Angrist and Pischke’s book:  I pretty much agree with them that the potential-outcomes or natural-experiment approach is the most useful way to think about causality in economics and related fields.  My main amendments to Angrist and Pischke would be to recognize that:
 
1.  Modeling is important, especially  modeling of interactions .  It’s unfortunate to see a debate between experimentalists and modelers.  Some experimenters (not Angrist and Pischke) make the mistake of avoiding models:  Once they have their experimental data, they check their brains at the door and do nothing but simple differences, not realizing how much more can be learned.  Conversely, some modelers are unduly dismissive of experiments and formal observational studies, forgetting t</p><p>5 0.7704221 <a title="789-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-10-Controversy_over_the_Christakis-Fowler_findings_on_the_contagion_of_obesity.html">757 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-10-Controversy over the Christakis-Fowler findings on the contagion of obesity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler are famous for finding that obesity is contagious.  Their claims, which have been received with both respect and skepticism (perhaps we need a new word for this:  “respecticism”?) are based on analysis of data from the Framingham heart study, a large longitudinal public-health study that happened to have some social network data (for the odd reason that each participant was asked to provide the name of a friend who could help the researchers locate them if they were to move away during the study period.
 
The short story is that if your close contact became obese, you were likely to become obese also.  The long story is a debate about the reliability of this finding (that is, can it be explained by measurement error and sampling variability) and its causal implications.
 
This sort of study is in my wheelhouse, as it were, but I have never looked at the Christakis-Fowler work in detail.  Thus, my previous and current comments are more along the line</p><p>6 0.76862013 <a title="789-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-31-Statistical_modeling%2C_causal_inference%2C_and_social_science.html">1645 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-31-Statistical modeling, causal inference, and social science</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Erin Jonaitis points us to  this article  by Christopher Ferguson and Moritz Heene, who write:
  
Publication bias remains a controversial issue in psychological science. . . . that the field often constructs arguments to block the publication and interpretation of null results and that null results may be further extinguished through questionable researcher practices. Given that science is dependent on the process of falsification, we argue that these problems reduce psychological science’s capability to have a proper mechanism for theory falsification, thus resulting in the promulgation of numerous “undead” theories that are ideologically popular but have little basis in fact.
  
They mention the infamous Daryl Bem article.  It is pretty much only because Bem’s claims are (presumably) false that they got published in a major research journal.  Had the claims been true—that is, had Bem run identical experiments, analyzed his data more carefully and objectively, and reported that the r</p><p>2 0.98635697 <a title="789-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-10-A_defense_of_Tom_Wolfe_based_on_the_impossibility_of_the_law_of_small_numbers_in_network_structure.html">1615 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-10-A defense of Tom Wolfe based on the impossibility of the law of small numbers in network structure</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A tall thin young man came to my office today to talk about one of my current pet topics:  stories and social science.  I brought up Tom Wolfe and his goal of compressing an entire city into a single novel, and how this reminded me of the psychologists Kahneman and Tversky’s concept of “the law of small numbers,” the idea that we expect any small sample to replicate all the properties of the larger population that it represents.  Strictly speaking, the law of small numbers is impossible—any small sample necessarily has its own unique features—but this is even more true if we consider network properties.
 
The average American knows about 700 people (depending on how you define “know”) and this defines a social network over the population.  Now suppose you look at a few hundred people and all their connections.  This mini-network will almost necessarily look much much sparser than the national network, as we’re removing the connections to the people not in the sample.

<p>Introduction: Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data :
  
We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a “generative model” for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation</p><p>4 0.9772675 <a title="789-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-15-%E2%80%9C10_Things_You_Need_to_Know_About_Causal_Effects%E2%80%9D.html">1675 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-15-“10 Things You Need to Know About Causal Effects”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Macartan Humphreys pointed me to  this excellent guide .
 
Here are the 10 items:
  
1. A causal claim is a statement about what didn’t happen. 
2. There is a fundamental problem of causal inference. 
3. You can estimate average causal effects even if you cannot observe any individual causal effects. 
4. If you know that, on average, A causes B and that B causes C, this does not mean that you know that A causes C. 
5. The counterfactual model is all about contribution, not attribution. 
6. X can cause Y even if there is no “causal path” connecting X and Y. 
7. Correlation is not causation. 
8. X can cause Y even if X is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition for Y. 
9. Estimating average causal effects does not require that treatment and control groups are identical. 
10. There is no causation without manipulation.

<p>Introduction: Steve Hsu, who  started off  this discussion, had some comments on  my speculations  on the personality of John von Neumann and others.  Steve writes:
  
I [Hsu] actually knew Feynman a bit when I was an undergrad, and found him to be very nice to students. Since then I have heard quite a few stories from people in theoretical physics which emphasize his nastier side, and I think in the end he was quite a complicated person like everyone else.


There are a couple of pseudo-biographies of vN, but none as high quality as, e.g., Gleick’s book on Feynman or Hodges book about Turing. (Gleick studied physics as an undergrad at Harvard, and Hodges is a PhD in mathematical physics — pretty rare backgrounds for biographers!)  For example, as mentioned on the comment thread to your post, Steve Heims wrote a book about both vN and Wiener (!),  and Norman Macrae wrote a biography of vN. Both books are worth reading, but I think neither really do him justice. The breadth of vN’s work is just too m</p><p>6 0.97704887 <a title="789-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-13-News_coverage_of_statistical_issues%E2%80%A6how_did_I_do%3F.html">514 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-13-News coverage of statistical issues…how did I do?</a></p>

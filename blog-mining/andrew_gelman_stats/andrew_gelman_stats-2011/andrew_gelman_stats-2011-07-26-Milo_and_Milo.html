<p>Introduction: Helen DeWitt  writes about  The Ask, the new book by Sam Lipsyte, author of a hilarious book I read a couple years ago about a loser guy who goes to his high school reunion.  I haven’t read Lipsyte’s new book but was interested to see that he teaches at Columbia.  Perhaps I can take him to lunch (either before or after I work up the courage to call Gary Shteyngart and ask him about my theory that the main character of that book is a symbol of modern-day America).
 
In any case, in the grand tradition of reviewing the review, I have some thoughts inspired by DeWitt, who quotes from  this interview :
  
LRS: I was studying writing at college and then this professor showed up, a disciple of Gordon Lish, and we operated according to the Lish method. You start reading your work and then as soon as you hit a false note she made you stop.


Lipsyte: Yeah, Lish would say, “That’s bullshit!”

<p>Introduction: This  amusing-yet-so-true video directed by Eléonore Pourriat shows a sex-role-reversed world where women are in charge and men don’t get taken seriously.  It’s convincing and affecting, but the twist that interests me comes at the end, when the real world returns.  It’s really creepy.
 
And this in turn reminds me of something we discussed here several years ago, the idea that alternative histories are made particularly compelling when they are grounded in the fact that the alternate world is not the real world.  Pourriat’s video would have been excellent even without its final scene, but that scene drives the point home in a way that I don’t think would’ve been possible had the video stayed entirely within its artificial world.
 
The point here is that the real world is indeed what is real.  This alternative sex-role-reversed world is not actually possible, and what makes it interesting to think about is the contrast to what really is.  If you set up an alternative history but you do</p><p>4 0.081601523 <a title="824-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-27-%E2%80%9CThe_ultimate_left-wing_novel%E2%80%9D.html">682 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-27-“The ultimate left-wing novel”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  asks  what is the ultimate left-wing novel?  He comes up with John Steinbeck and refers us to  this list  by Josh Leach that includes soclal-realist novels from around 1900.  But Cowen is looking for something more “analytically or philosophically comprehensive.”
 
My vote for the ultimate left-wing novel is 1984.  The story and the political philosophy fit together well, and it’s also widely read (which is an important part of being the “ultimate” novel of any sort, I think; it wouldn’t do to choose something too obscure).  Or maybe Gulliver’s Travels, but I’ve never actually read that, so I don’t know if it qualifies as being left-wing.  Certainly you can’t get much more political than 1984, and I don’t think you can get much more left-wing either.  (If you get any more left-wing than that, you start to loop around the circle and become right-wing.  For example, I don’t think that a novel extolling the brilliance of Stalin or Mao would be considered left-wing in a modern</p><p>5 0.077965476 <a title="824-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-28-Advice_to_help_the_rich_get_richer.html">8 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-28-Advice to help the rich get richer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  reviews  a recent book, “Lifecyle Investing,” by Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff, two professors of management at Yale.  The book recommends that young adults take out loans to buy stocks and then hold these stocks for many years to prepare for retirement.
 
What I’m wondering is:  What’s the goal of writing this sort of book?  The main audience has got to be young adults (and their parents) who are already pretty well fixed, financially.  Students at Yale, for example.  And the book must be intended for people who are already beyond the standard recommendations of personal-investment books (pay off your credit card debt, don’t waste so much money on restaurant meals and fancy clothes, buy 1 used car instead of 2 new ones, etc).  Basically it sounds like they’re talking to people who have a lot of money but want to make sure that they retire rich rather than merely middle-class.

<p>Introduction: I read the excerpt in n+1.  As one would expect of DeWitt, it was great, while being nothing at all like her  other  book.  THe new book reminded me a bit of Philip K. Dick.  Here’s a brief excerpt (which is not actually particularly PKD-like) of the main character talking to himself:
  
“I don’t have what it takes,” he said.  He had never said it before because saying it would be like admitting he couldn’t make the grade.
  
I’m not pulling out this quote to sell you on the book.  The lines just struck me because of the exquisite distinctions, the idea that “don’t have what it takes” is somehow different than “couldn’t make the grade,” the idea that this character, who expresses his thoughts in empty phrases, ends up assigning to these phrases a set of precise meanings that make sense only to him.

<p>Introduction: I was reading a book of Alfred Kazin’s letters—I don’t know if they’d be so interesting to someone who hadn’t already read a bunch of his  stuff , but I found them pretty interesting—and came across this amazing bit, dated August 11, 1957:
 
 
 
No, really, Al.  Tell us what you really feel.  This was in his private diary, so I can’t really criticize him for it.  And all of us have private thoughts, sometimes publicly expressed, that are unworthy of our better self.  For example, once I was crossing a street and a taxi driver came dangerously close, and I screamed at him, “Go back to your own country, you #&@#%*^&.”  So I’m not claiming that I’m any better than Kazin.  I just thought that quote was pretty amazing.  I guess that’s how (some) people thought, back in the fifties.
 
Also interesting that he wrote “ass-hole” in that context.  The hyphen surprised me, also I don’t think people would use that word in this way anymore.  Nowadays I think of an asshole as a person, not a place.</p><p>5 0.81544036 <a title="824-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-21-Careers%2C_one-hit_wonders%2C_and_an_offer_of_a_free_book.html">46 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-21-Careers, one-hit wonders, and an offer of a free book</a></p>
<p>Introduction: J. Robert Lennon  writes :
  
At the moment I [Lennon] am simultaneously working on two magazine articles, each requiring me to assess not just a book, but (briefly) a writer’s entire career. The writers in question are both prominent, both widely published, read, and appreciated. And yet neither, I think, enjoys a full appreciation of their career–its real scope, with all its twists and turns, its eccentricities intact.


In one case, the writer had one smash hit, and one notorious book everyone hates. In the other, the writer has somehow become known as the author of one really serious book that gets taught a lot in college classes, and a bunch of other stuff generally thought to be a little bit frivolous. But close readings of each (hell, not even that close) reveals these reputations to be woefully inadequate. Both writers are much more interesting than their hits and bombs would suggest. 
  
This naturally got me thinking about statisticians.

<p>Introduction: A moviegoing colleague writes:
  
I just watched the movie Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.  What struck me about it was: (1) Bayes theorem underlies the whole movie; (2) CIA top brass do not know Bayes theorem (at least as portrayed in the movie).


Obviously one does not need to know physics to play billiards, but it helps with the reasoning.


Essentially, at some point the key CIA agent locates what she strongly believes is OBL’s hidding place in Pakistan.  Then it takes the White House some 150 days to make the decision to attack the compound.  Why so long? And why, even on the eve of the operation, were senior brass only some 60% OBL was there?  


Fear of false positives is the answer.  After all, the compound could belong to a drug lord, or some other terrorist.  Here is the math:


There are two possibilities, according to movie: OBL is in a compound (C) in a city or he is in the mountains in tribal regions.  Say P(OBL in C) = 0.5.

<p>Introduction: A few days ago I  discussed  the evaluation of somewhat-plausible claims that are somewhat supported by theory and somewhat supported by statistical evidence.  One point I raised was that an implausibly large estimate of effect size can be cause for concern:
  
Uri Simonsohn (the author of the recent rebuttal of the name-choice article by Pelham et al.) argued that the implied effects were too large to be believed (just as I was arguing above regarding the July 4th study), which makes more plausible his claims that the results arise from methodological artifacts.


That calculation is straight Bayes: the distribution of systematic errors has much longer tails than the distribution of random errors, so the larger the estimated effect, the more likely it is to be a mistake. This little theoretical result is a bit annoying, because it is the larger effects that are the most interesting!”
  
Larry Bartels notes that my reasoning above is a bit incoherent:

<p>Introduction: A journalist wrote to me recently:
  
I was going to include your deconstruction of the beautiful daughters paper, but ran out of space. The author, incidentally, stands by that paper — and emailed me that you’d advised him on a later paper, implying that meant you now accepted the thesis!
  
I responded:
  
I know that Kanazawa stands by his earlier claim.  Unfortunately, in this case, “stands by” means believing something with no evidence. And, yes, he send me a copy of his other paper, and I responded by telling him I thought his sample size is too small.  I did advise him, and my advice was to not do it!
  
To avoid any future confusion, I thought I’d post my half of my emails with Kanazawa over the years: 
   
28 Aug 2006:

I read with interest your papers on sex ratios in the Journal of Theoretical Biology.

<p>Introduction: A graduate student in public health writes:
  
I have been asked to do the statistical analysis for a medical unit that is delivering a pilot study of a program to [details redacted to prevent identification]. They are using a prospective, nonrandomized, cohort-controlled trial study design.


The investigator thinks they can recruit only a small number of treatment and control cases, maybe less than 30 in total.  After I told the Investigator that I cannot do anything statistically with a sample size that small, he responded that small sample sizes are common in this field, and he send me an example of analysis that someone had done on a similar study.


So he still wants me to come up with a statistical plan. Is it unethical for me to do anything other than descriptive statistics? I think he should just stick to qualitative research. But the study she mentions above has 40 subjects and apparently had enough power to detect some effects. This is a pilot study after all so the n does n</p><p>5 0.15611528 <a title="963-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-25-Design_of_nonrandomized_cluster_sample_study.html">820 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-25-Design of nonrandomized cluster sample study</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rhoderick Machekano writes:
  
I have a design question which has been bothering me and wonder if you can clear for me. In my line of work, we often conveniently select health centers and from those sample patients. When I am doing sample size estimation under this design do I account for the design effect – since I expect outcomes in patients from the same health center to be correlated? Given that I didn’t random sample the health facilities, is my only limitation that I cannot generalize the results and make group level comparisons in the analysis?
  
My response:
 
You can generalize the results even if you didn’t randomly sample the health facilities.  The only thing is that your generalization applies to the implicit population of facilities to which your sample is representative.  You could try to move further on this by considering facility-level predictors.  Regarding sample size estimation, see  chapter 20 .</p><p>6 0.1518067 <a title="963-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-01-Why_big_effects_are_more_important_than_small_effects.html">1744 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-01-Why big effects are more important than small effects</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Josef Fruehwald  writes :
  
In the past few years, the empirical foundations of the social sciences, especially Psychology, have been coming under increased scrutiny and criticism. For example, there was the New Yorker piece from 2010 called “The Truth Wears Off” about the “decline effect,” or how the effect size of a phenomenon appears to decrease over time. . . .


I [Fruehwald] am a linguist. Do the problems facing psychology face me? To really answer that, I first have to decide which explanation for the decline effect I think is most likely, and I think Andrew Gelman’s proposal is a good candidate:

 
The short story is that if you screen for statistical significance when estimating small effects, you will necessarily overestimate the magnitudes of effects, sometimes by a huge amount.
 

I’ve put together some R code to demonstrate this point. Let’s say I’m looking at two populations, and unknown to me as a researcher, there is a small difference between the two, even though they</p><p>3 0.82951778 <a title="963-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-04-27-Should_Mister_P_be_allowed-encouraged_to_reside_in_counter-factual_populations%3F.html">7 andrew gelman stats-2010-04-27-Should Mister P be allowed-encouraged to reside in counter-factual populations?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lets say you are repeatedly going to recieve unselected sets of well done RCTs on various say medical treatments.
 
One reasonable assumption with all of these treatments is that they are monotonic – either helpful or harmful for all. The treatment effect will (as always) vary for subgroups in the population – these will not be explicitly identified in the studies – but each study very likely will enroll different percentages of the variuos patient subgroups. Being all randomized studies these subgroups will be balanced in the treatment versus control arms – but each study will (as always) be estimating a different – but exchangeable – treatment effect (Exhangeable due to the ignorance about the subgroup memberships of the enrolled patients.) 
 
That reasonable assumption – monotonicity – will be to some extent (as always) wrong, but given that it is a risk believed well worth taking – if the average effect in any population is positive (versus negative) the average effect in any other</p><p>4 0.82597899 <a title="963-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-01-Why_big_effects_are_more_important_than_small_effects.html">1744 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-01-Why big effects are more important than small effects</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The title of this post is silly but I have an important point to make, regarding an implicit model which I think many people assume even though it does not really make sense.
 
Following a link from Sanjay Srivastava, I came across  a post  from David Funder saying that it’s useful to talk about the sizes of effects (I actually prefer the term “comparisons” so as to avoid the causal baggage) rather than just their signs.  I  agree , and I wanted to elaborate a bit on a point that comes up in Funder’s discussion.  He quotes an (unnamed) prominent social psychologist as writing:
  
The key to our research . . . [is not] to accurately estimate effect size. If I were testing an advertisement for a marketing research firm and wanted to be sure that the cost of the ad would produce enough sales to make it worthwhile, effect size would be crucial. But when I am testing a theory about whether, say, positive mood reduces information processing in comparison with negative mood, I am worried abou</p><p>5 0.81211263 <a title="963-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-27-%E2%80%9CWhat_Can_we_Learn_from_the_Many_Labs_Replication_Project%3F%E2%80%9D.html">2227 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-27-“What Can we Learn from the Many Labs Replication Project?”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aki points us to  this discussion  from Rolf Zwaan:
  
The first massive replication project in psychology has just reached completion (several others are to follow). . . . What can we learn from the ManyLabs project? The results here show the effect sizes for the replication efforts (in green and grey) as well as the original studies (in blue). The 99% confidence intervals are for the meta-analysis of the effect size (the green dots); the studies are ordered by effect size.


 


Let’s first consider what we canNOT learn from these data. Of the 13 replication attempts (when the first four are taken together), 11 succeeded and 2 did not (in fact, at some point ManyLabs suggests that a third one, Imagined Contact also doesn’t really replicate). We cannot learn from this that the vast majority of psychological findings will replicate . . .


But even if we had an accurate estimate of the percentage of findings that replicate, how useful would that be?

Today during the group meeting at my new job we were revising a paper whose main conclusions were sustained by an ANOVA.


One of the first observations is that the experiment had a small sample size. Interestingly (may not so), some of the reported effects (most of them interactions) were quite large. One of the experience group members said that “there is a common wisdom that one should not believe effects from small sample sizes but [he thinks] if they [the effects] are large enough to be picked on a small study they must be real large effects”. I argued that if the sample size is small one could incur on a M-type error in which the magnitude of the effect is being over-estimated and that if larger samples are evaluated the magnitude may become smaller and also the confidence intervals. The concept of M-type error is completely new to all other members of the group (on which I am in my second week) and I was given the job of finding a suitable ref to explain</p><p>2 0.96812904 <a title="963-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-17-Modeling_group-level_predictors_in_a_multilevel_regression.html">1216 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-17-Modeling group-level predictors in a multilevel regression</a></p>

Do you have suggestions as to model selection strategies akin to Bayesian model averaging for multilevel models when level-2 inputs are of substantive interest? I [Causey] have seen plenty of R packages and procedures for non-multilevel models, and tried the glmulti package but found that it did not perform well with more than a few level-2 variables.
  
My quick answer is:  with a name like that, you should really be fitting three-level models!
 
My longer answer is:  regular readers will be unsurprised to hear that I’m no fan of  Bayesian model averaging .  Instead I’d prefer to bite the bullet and assign an informative prior distribution on these coefficients.  I don’t have a great example of such an analysis but I’m more and more thinking that this is the way to go.  I don’t see the point in aiming for the intermediate goal of pruning the predictors; I’d rather have a procedure that includes prior information on the predictors and their interactions.</p><p>3 0.96734977 <a title="963-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-11-News_flash%3A__Probability_and_statistics_are_hard_to_understand.html">1413 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-11-News flash:  Probability and statistics are hard to understand</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Two people pointed me to an article by Emre Soyer and Robin Hogarth that was  linked to  by Felix Salmon.
 
Here are my reactions: 
   
1.  Soyer and Hogarth’s paper seems very strong to me, and Salmon’s presentation is an impressive condensation of it.  I’d say good job on the science and the reporting.
 
2.  I don’t see the point of focusing on economists.  This seems just like a gimmick to me.  But, then again, I’m not an economist.  So of course I’d be more interested in a similar paper studying political scientists or statisticians.  This should be easy enough for someone to do, of course.
 
3.  To elaborate on this last point:  I’m not surprised that people, even expert practitioners, screw up with statistics.  Kahneman and Tversky found this with psychology researchers back in the 1970s.  I’m not knocking the current paper by Soyer and Hogarth but I don’t see it as surprising. Perhaps the focus on economists is what allowed it to get all this attention.

<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  here  from Mark Palko.
 
 
 
I think of Palko’s post as having a lot of statistical content here, although it’s hard for me to say exactly why it feels that way to me.  Perhaps it has to do with the challenges of measurement, how something that would seem to be a simple problem of measurement (adding up the cost of staple foods) isn’t so easy after all, in fact it requires a lot of subject-matter knowledge, in this case knowledge that some guy named Ron Shaich whom I’ve never heard of (but that’s ok, I’m sure he’s never heard of me either) doesn’t have.  We’ve been talking a lot about measurement on this blog recently (for example,  here ), and I think this new story fits into these discussions somehow.</p><p>5 0.96122861 <a title="963-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-19-The_mysterious_Gamma_%281.4%2C_0.4%29.html">669 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-19-The mysterious Gamma (1.4, 0.4)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A student writes:
  
I have a question about an earlier recommendation of yours on the election of the prior distribution for the precision hyperparameter of a normal distribution, and a reference for the recommendation. If I recall correctly I have read that you have suggested to use Gamma(1.4, 0.4) instead of Gamma(0.01,0.01) for the prior distribution of the precision hyper parameter of a normal distribution.


I would very much appreciate if you would have the time to point me to this publication of yours. The reason is that I have used the prior distribution (Gamma(1.4, 0.4)) in a study which we now revise for publication, and where a reviewer question the choice of the distribution (claiming that it is too informative!).


I am well aware of that you in recent publications (Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models.

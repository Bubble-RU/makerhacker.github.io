We have only recently chanced upon your blog while we were looking for responses to the “decline effect” in medical and scientific studies. We were especially taken by your comment that there is something wrong with the scientific method “if this method is defined as running experiments and doing data analysis in a patternless way and then reporting, as true, results that pass a statistical significance threshold.” To us, that seems to be standard operating procedure in much of social science, including our own field of education. Indeed quasi-experimental designs are the stock in trade of those who attempt to use “science” — we dare not say haruspicy, but you can if you like — to influence the course of public policy.

<p>Introduction: In one of the final Jitts, we asked the students how the course could be improved.  Some of their suggestions would work, some would not.  I’m putting all the suggestions below, interpolating my responses.  (Overall, I think the course went well.  Please remember that the remarks below are not course evaluations; they are answers to my specific question of how the course could be better.  If we’d had a Jitt asking all the ways the course was good, you’d be seeing lots of positive remarks.  But that wouldn’t be particularly useful or interesting.)  The best thing about the course is that the kids worked hard each week on their homeworks.
 
OK, here are the comments and my replies: 
  
  
Could have been better if we did less amount but more in detail.
  
I don’t know if this would’ve been possible.  I wanted to get to the harder stuff (HMC, VB, nonparametric models) which required a certain amount of preparation.  And, even so, there was not time for everything.

<p>Introduction: Upon returning from sabbatical I came across a few magazines from a year ago that I hadn’t gotten around to reading.  I’m thinking that I should read everything on a one-year delay.  The too-topical stuff (for example, promos tied to upcoming movies) I can ignore, and other items are enhanced by knowing what happened a year or two later.
 
For example, the 11 May 2009 issue of the New Yorker featured  an article  by Douglas McGray about an organization in Los Angeles called Green Dot that runs charter schools.  According to the article, Green Dot, unlike typical charter school operators, educate just about everyone in their schools’ areas and so don’t benefit so much from  selection .  I don’t know enough about the details to evaluate these claims, but I was curious about this bit:
  
[L.A. schools superintendent] Cortines has also agreed in principle to a partnership in Los Angeles. . . . Green Dot could take over as many as five Los Angeles schools in 2010, and maybe more.

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  points  to a  news article  by Michael Winerip on teacher assessment:
  
No one at the Lab Middle School for Collaborative Studies works harder than Stacey Isaacson, a seventh-grade English and social studies teacher. She is out the door of her Queens home by 6:15 a.m., takes the E train into Manhattan and is standing out front when the school doors are unlocked, at 7. Nights, she leaves her classroom at 5:30. . . .


Her principal, Megan Adams, has given her terrific reviews during the two and a half years Ms. Isaacson has been a teacher. . . . The Lab School has selective admissions, and Ms. Isaacson’s students have excelled. Her first year teaching, 65 of 66 scored proficient on the state language arts test, meaning they got 3′s or 4′s; only one scored below grade level with a 2. More than two dozen students from her first two years teaching have gone on to . . . the city’s most competitive high schools. . . .

<p>Introduction: Wayne Folta writes, “In light of your recent  blog post  on women in higher education, here’s one I  just read about  on a techie website regarding elementary education”:
  
Why do girls get better grades in elementary school than boys—even when they perform worse on standardized tests?


New research . . . suggests that it’s because of their classroom behavior, which may lead teachers to assign girls higher grades than their male counterparts. . . . The study, co-authored by [Christopher] Cornwell and David Mustard at UGA and Jessica Van Parys at Columbia, analyzed data on more than 5,800 students from kindergarten through fifth grade. It examined students’ performance on standardized tests in three categories—reading, math and science-linking test scores to teachers’ assessments of their students’ progress, both academically and more broadly.


The data show, for the first time, that gender disparities in teacher grades start early and uniformly favor girls. In every subject area, bo</p><p>4 0.81431562 <a title="542-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-06-17-My_proposal_for_making_college_admissions_fairer.html">93 andrew gelman stats-2010-06-17-My proposal for making college admissions fairer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After reading the  Rewarding Strivers book , I had some thoughts about how to make the college admissions system more fair to students from varying socioeconomic backgrounds.  Instead of boosting up the disadvantaged students, why not pull down the advantaged students?
 
Here’s the idea.  Disadvantaged students are defined typically not by a bad thing that they have, but rather by good things that they  don’t  have:  financial resources, a high-quality education, and so forth.  In contrast, advantaged students get all sorts of freebies.  So here are my suggestions:
  

 
1.  All high school grades on a 4-point scale (A=4, B=3, etc).  No more of this 5-points-for-an-A-in-an-AP course, which gives the ridiculous outcomes of kids graduating with a 4.3 average, not so fair to kids in schools that don’t offer a lot of AP classes.
 
2.  Subtract points for taking the SAT multiple times.  A simple rule would be:  You can use your highest SAT score, but you lose 50 points for every other time</p><p>5 0.79400057 <a title="542-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-15-Progress_in_U.S._education%3B_also%2C_a_discussion_of_what_it_takes_to_hit_the_op-ed_pages.html">1265 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-15-Progress in U.S. education; also, a discussion of what it takes to hit the op-ed pages</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Howard Wainer  writes :
  
When we focus only on the differences between groups, we too easily lose track of the big picture. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the current public discussions of the size of the gap in test scores that is observed between racial groups. It has been noted that in New Jersey the gap between the average scores of white and black students on the well-developed scale of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has shrunk by only about 25 percent over the past two decades. The conclusion drawn was that even though the change is in the right direction, it is far too slow.


But focusing on the difference blinds us to what has been a remarkable success in education over the past 20 years. Although the direction and size of student improvements are considered across many subject areas and many age groups, I will describe just one — 4th grade mathematics. . . . there have been steep gains for both racial groups over this period (somewhat steeper g</p><p>6 0.78070062 <a title="542-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-27-Grade_inflation%3A__why_weren%E2%80%99t_the_instructors_all_giving_all_A%E2%80%99s_already%3F%3F.html">825 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-27-Grade inflation:  why weren’t the instructors all giving all A’s already??</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Interesting discussion  here  by Mark Palko on the difficulty of comparing charter schools to regular schools, even if the slots in the charter schools have been assigned by lottery.  Beyond the direct importance of the topic, I found the discussion interesting because I always face a challenge in my own teaching to assign the right amount of homework, given that if I assign too much, students will simply rebel and not do it.
 
To get back to the school-choice issue . . . Mark discussed selection effects:  if a charter school is popular, it can require parents to sign a contract agreeing they will supervise their students to do lots of homework.  Mark points out that there is a selection issue here, that the sort of parents who would sign that form are different from parents in general.  But it seems to me there’s one more twist:  These charter schools are popular, right?  So that would imply that there is some reservoir of parents who would like to sign the form but don’t have the opp</p><p>2 0.91787457 <a title="542-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-10-Psychology_can_be_improved_by_adding_some_economics.html">1717 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-10-Psychology can be improved by adding some economics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On this blog I’ve occasionally written about the problems that arise when economists act as amateur psychologists.  But the problem can go the other way, too.  For example, consider  this blog  by Berit Brogaard and Kristian Marlow ( link  from Abbas Raza).  Brogaard and Marlow give several amusing stories about ripoffs (a restaurant that scams customers into buying expensive bottles of wine, a hairdresser that sucks customers into unnecessary treatments, a ghostwriter who takes thousands of dollars in payments and doesn’t do the job, etc.).  Then they ask, “How did it happen? Why did you act in this impulsive way? Why didn’t you learn your lesson the first time around? Do you have some kind of brain damage?”
 
They continue with some discussion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the anterior insula, etc etc etc., and then conclude with the following advice:
  
Is there anything we can do to avoid these moments of crazy decision-making? Yes but only by intentionally turning on our</p><p>3 0.91084576 <a title="542-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-28-Behavioral_economics_doesn%E2%80%99t_seem_to_have_much_to_say_about_marriage.html">594 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-28-Behavioral economics doesn’t seem to have much to say about marriage</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  was just bizarre.  It’s an interview with Colin Camerer, a professor of finance and economics at Caltech, The topic is Camerer’s marriage, but what’s weird is that he doesn’t say anything specific about his wife at all.  All we get are witticisms of the sub-Henny-Youngman level, for example, in response to the question, “Any free riding in your household?”, Camerer says:
  
No. Here’s why: I am one of the world’s leading experts on psychology, the brain and strategic game theory. But my wife is a woman. So it’s a tie.
  
Also some schoolyard evolutionary biology (“men signaling that they will help you raise your baby after conception, and women signaling fidelity” blah blah blah) and advice for husbands in “upper-class marriages with assets.”  (No advice to the wives, but maybe that’s a good thing.)  And here are his insights on love and marriage:
  
Marriage is like hot slow-burning embers compared to the flashy flames of love.

<p>Introduction: After I recently  criticized  Gregg Easterbrook for assigning Obama an implausible 90+% chance of beating Mitt Romney, some commenters thought I was being too critical, that I should cut Easterbrook some slack because he just was speaking metaphorically.
 
In other words, Easterbrook is a “qual.”  He uses numbers in his writing because that’s what everyone is supposed to do nowadays, but he doesn’t intend those numbers to be meant literally.  Similarly, he presumably didn’t really mean it when he  wrote  that Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren “couldn’t be more different — personally or politically.”  And he had no problem  typing  that Obama’s approval rating was 23% because, to him, “23%” is just another word for “low.”
 
He’s a qual, that’s all.
 
Similarly, when Samantha Power was just being a qual when she wrote the meaningful-sounding but actually empty statement, “Since 1968, with the single exception of the election of George W. Bush in 2000, Americans have chosen Republican pres</p><p>5 0.90726191 <a title="542-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-16-%E2%80%9CFalse-positive_psychology%E2%80%9D.html">1171 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-16-“False-positive psychology”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Everybody’s  talkin bout  this paper by Joseph Simmons, Leif Nelson and Uri Simonsohn, who  write :
  
Despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We [Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn] present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.

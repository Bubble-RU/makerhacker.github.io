I remember reading on your blog that you were working on some tools to fit multilevel models that also include “fixed” effects — such as continuous predictors — that are also estimated with shrinkage (for example, an L1 or L2 penalty). Any new developments on this front?


I often find myself wanting to fit a multilevel model to some data, but also needing to include a number of “fixed” effects, mainly continuous variables. This makes me wary of overfitting to these predictors, so then I’d want to use some kind of shrinkage.


As far as I can tell, the main options for doing this now is by going fully Bayesian and using a Gibbs sampler. With MCMCglmm or BUGS/JAGS I could just specify a prior on the fixed effects that corresponds to a desired penalty. However, this is pretty slow, especially with a large data set and because I’d like to select the penalty parameter by cross-validation (which is where this isn’t very Bayesian I guess?).

It started when Jeff Lax made  this comment  on his recent blog entry:
  
 Nebraska Is All That Counts for a Party-Bucking Nelson 


Dem Senator On Blowback From His Opposition To Kagan: ‘Are They From Nebraska? Then I Don’t Care’


Fine, but 62% of Nebraskans with an opinion favor confirmation… 91% of Democrats, 39% of Republicans, and 61% of Independents. So I guess he only cares about Republican Nebraskans…
  
I conferred with Jeff and then wrote the following entry for fivethirtyeight.com.  There was a backlog of posts at 538 at the time, so I set it on delay to appear the following morning.

<p>Introduction: Here’s my discussion of  this article  for the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society:
 
I will comment on this paper in my role as applied statistician and consumer of Bayesian computation.  In the last few years, my colleagues and I have felt the need to fit predictive survey responses given multiple discrete predictors, for example estimating voting given ethnicity and income within each of the fifty states, or estimating public opinion about gay marriage given age, sex, ethnicity, education, and state.  We would like to be able to fit such models with ten or more predictors–for example, religion, religious attendance, marital status, and urban/rural/suburban residence in addition to the factors mentioned above.
 
There are (at least) three reasons for fitting a model with many predictive factors and potentially a huge number of interactions among them:
 
1.  Deep interactions can be of substantive interest.  For example, Gelman et al. (2009) discuss the importance of  interaction</p><p>5 0.14902993 <a title="962-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-15-Mr._P_by_another_name_._._._is_still_great%21.html">769 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-15-Mr. P by another name . . . is still great!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Brendan Nyhan points me to  this  from Don Taylor:
  
Can national data be used to estimate state-level results? . . . A challenge is the fact that the sample size in many states is very small . . . Richard [Gonzales] used a regression approach to extrapolate this information to provide a state-level support for health reform:

 
To get around the challenge presented by small sample sizes, the model presented here combines the benefits of incorporating auxiliary demographic information about the states with the hierarchical modeling approach commonly used in small area estimation. The model is designed to “shrink” estimates toward the average level of support in the region when there are few observations available, while simultaneously adjusting for the demographics and political ideology in the state. This approach therefore takes fuller advantage of all information available in the data to estimate state-level public opinion.

<p>Introduction: Mike Spagat sent me an email with the above heading, referring to  this paper  by Leontine Alkema and Jin Rou New, which begins:
  
National estimates of the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) are used to track progress in reducing child mortality and to evaluate countries’ performance related to United Nations Millennium Development Goal 4, which calls for a reduction in the U5MR by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. However, for the great majority of developing countries without well-functioning vital registration systems, estimating levels and trends in child mortality is challenging, not only because of limited data availability but also because of issues with data quality. Global U5MR estimates are often constructed without accounting for potential biases in data series, which may lead to inaccurate point estimates and/or credible intervals.


We describe a Bayesian penalized B-spline regression model for assessing levels and trends in the U5MR for all countries in the world, whereby bi</p><p>3 0.76363969 <a title="962-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-15-Mr._P_by_another_name_._._._is_still_great%21.html">769 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-15-Mr. P by another name . . . is still great!</a></p>

 Razib Khan  asks:
  
But follow the gradient from El Paso to the Illinois-Missouri border. The differences are small across state lines, but the consistent differences along the borders really don’t make. Are there state-level policies or regulations causing this? Or, are there state-level differences in measurement? This weird pattern shows up in other CDC data I’ve seen.

  
Turns out that CDC isn’t providing  data , they’re providing  model . Frank Howland answered: 
  

I suspect the answer has to do with the manner in which the county estimates are produced. I went to the original data source, the CDC, and then to the  relevant FAQ .

<p>Introduction: Jay Ulfelder asks:
  
I have a question for you about what to do in a situation where you have two measures of your dependent variable and no prior reasons to strongly favor one over the other.


Here’s what brings this up: I’m working on a project with Michael Ross where we’re modeling transitions to and from democracy in countries worldwide since 1960 to estimate the effects of oil income on the likelihood of those events’ occurrence. We’ve got a TSCS data set, and we’re using a discrete-time event history design, splitting the sample by regime type at the start of each year and then using multilevel logistic regression models with parametric measures of time at risk and random intercepts at the country and region levels. (We’re also checking for the usefulness of random slopes for oil wealth at one or the other level and then including them if they improve a model’s goodness of fit.) All of this is being done in Stata with the gllamm module.

<p>Introduction: For the past few weeks I’ve been in pain much of the time, some sort of spasms in my neck and shoulder.  Things are mostly better now, but last night I woke up at 5am and my neck was killing me.  On the upside, I’d just been having a dream about multiple imputation and in the dream I had a brilliant idea of how to reconcile conditional and joint model specifications.  Amazingly enough, when I awoke, I remembered the idea from the dream, and, even more amazingly, it really was a good idea.  And, I was in pain and couldn’t fall back asleep.  That was good news because that meant I didn’t forget the idea.  I mentioned it to Jingchen in our midday meeting today and he didn’t shoot it down.
 
At this point, I don’t really know what will happen.  Sometimes I have a sudden inspiration and is works out  just as planned  or even  better than anticipated ; other times, what seems like a brilliant plan goes nowhere.  For this new idea, the next step is the hard work of pushing it through and seei</p><p>2 0.97135341 <a title="962-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-18-Is_it_really_true_that_only_8%25_of_people_who_buy_Herbalife_products_are_Herbalife_distributors%3F.html">1679 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-18-Is it really true that only 8% of people who buy Herbalife products are Herbalife distributors?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A reporter emailed me the other day with a question about a case I’d never heard of before, a company called Herbalife that is being accused of being a pyramid scheme.  The reporter pointed me to  this document  which describes a survey conducted by “a third party firm called Lieberman Research”:
  
Two independent studies took place using real time (aka “river”) sampling, in which respondents 
were intercepted across a wide array of websites


Sample size of 2,000 adults 18+ matched to U.S. census on age, gender, income, region and ethnicity
  
“River sampling” in this case appears to mean, according to the reporter, that “people were invited into it through online ads.”  The survey found that 5% of U.S. households had purchased Herbalife products during the past three months (with a “0.8% margin of error,” ha ha ha).
 
They they did a multiplication and a division to estimate that only 8% of households who bought these products were Herbalife distributors:  480,000 active distributor</p><p>same-blog 3 0.96429002 <a title="962-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-17-Death%21.html">962 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-17-Death!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This graph shows the estimate that Kenny Shirley and I have of support for the death penalty by sex and race in the U.S. since 1955:
 
   
 
We also found that capital punishment used to be more popular in the Northeast than in the South, but now it’s the other way around.
 
Here’s the abstract to  our paper :
  
One of the longest running questions that has been regularly included in Gallup’s national public opinion poll is “Do you favor or oppose the death penalty for persons convicted of murder?” Because the death penalty is governed by state laws rather than federal laws, it is of special interest to know how public opinion varies by state, and how it has changed over time within each state. In this paper we combine dozens of national polls taken over a fifty-year span and fit a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression model to individual response data to estimate changes in state-level public opinion over time. Such a long span of polls has not been analyzed this way before, partly</p><p>4 0.96211386 <a title="962-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-13-Preregistration_of_Studies_and_Mock_Reports.html">1671 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-13-Preregistration of Studies and Mock Reports</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The traditional system of scientific and scholarly publishing is breaking down in two different directions.
 
On one hand, we are moving away from relying on a small set of journals as gatekeepers: the number of papers and research projects is increasing, the number of publication outlets is increasing, and important manuscripts are being posted on SSRN, Arxiv, and other nonrefereed sites.
 
At the same time, many researchers are worried about the profusion of published claims that turn out to not replicate or in plain language, to be false. This concern is not new–some prominent discussions include Rosenthal (1979), Ioannidis (2005), and Vul et al. (2009)–but there is a growing sense that the scientific signal is being swamped by noise.
 
I recently had the opportunity to comment in the journal Political Analysis on two papers, one by Humphreys, Sierra, and Windt, and one by Monogan, on the preregistration of studies and mock reports.   Here’s  the issue of the journal.

<p>Introduction: In reaction to  this  news article by Michael Kimmelman, I’d like to repost  this  from four years ago:
  
Walking through Penn Station in New York, I remembered how much I love its open structure. By “open,” I don’t mean bright and airy. I mean “open” in a topological sense. The station has three below-ground levels–the uppermost has ticket counters (and, what is more relevant nowadays, ticket machines), some crappy stores and restaurants, and a crappy waiting area. The middle level has Long Island Rail Road ticket counters, some more crappy stores and restaurants, and entrances to the 7th and 8th Avenue subway lines. The lower level has train tracks and platforms. There are stairs, escalators, and elevators going everywhere. As a result, it’s easy to get around, there are lots of shortcuts, and the train loads fast–some people come down the escalators and elevators from the top level, others take the stairs from the middle level.

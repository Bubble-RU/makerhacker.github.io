This time the bad tidings come from Marjan Bakker and Jelte Wicherts, who  write :
  
Around 18% of statistical results in the psychological literature are incorrectly reported. Inconsistencies were more common in low-impact journals than in high-impact journals. Moreover, around 15% of the articles contained at least one statistical conclusion that proved, upon recalculation, to be incorrect; that is, recalculation rendered the previously significant result insignificant, or vice versa. These errors were often in line with researchers’ expectations.
  
Their research also had a qualitative component:
  
To obtain a better understanding of the origins of the errors made in the reporting of statistics, we contacted the authors of the articles with errors in the second study and asked them to send us the raw data.

<p>Introduction: I just wanted to point out  this comment  of mine which applies the principles of analysis of variance to an informal model of political opinions and intellectual stances.
 
I hate it when my best lines are buried within a comment thread.  (I also hate that I respond to blog comments rather than doing real work, but thatâ&euro;&trade;s another story.  One of the good things about blogging for 538, back when I was doing that, was that the comments were soooo bad I just stopped reading them.  Commenters here often have something interesting to say.)

<p>Introduction: Kaiser  writes :
  
I have read a fair share of bore-them-to-tears compilation of survey research results – you know, those presentations with one multi-colored, stacked or grouped bar chart after another, extending for dozens of pages.
  
I hate those grouped bar charts also—as I’ve written repeatedly, the central role of almost all statistical displays is to make comparisons, and you can make twice as many comparisons with a line plot as a bar plot.
 
But I suspect the real problem with the reports that Kaiser is talking about is the “extending for dozens of pages” part.  If they could just print each individual plot smaller and put dozens on a page, you could maybe get through the whole report in two or three pages.  Almost always, graphs are too large.  I’ve even seen abominations such as a fifty-page report with a single huge pie chart on each page.
 
As Kaiser says, think about communication!  A report with one big pie chart or bar plot per page is like a text document with one w</p><p>5 0.1496895 <a title="991-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-02-Another_retraction.html">1359 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-02-Another retraction</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  our new ethics column for Chance , Eric Loken and I write about our current favorite topic:
  
One of our ongoing themes when discussing scientific ethics is the central role of statistics in recognizing and communicating uncer- 
tainty. Unfortunately, statistics—and the scientific process more generally—often seems to be used more as a way of laundering uncertainty, processing data until researchers and consumers of research can feel safe acting as if various scientific hypotheses are unquestionably true. . . .


We have in mind an analogy with the notorious AAA-class bonds created during the mid-2000s that led to the subprime mortgage crisis. Lower-quality mortgages—that is, mortgages with high probability of default and, thus, high uncertainty—were packaged and transformed into financial instruments that were (in retrospect, falsely) characterized as low risk. There was a tremendous interest in these securities, not just among the most unscrupulous market manipulators, but in a</p><p>4 0.69674027 <a title="991-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-11-News_flash%3A__Probability_and_statistics_are_hard_to_understand.html">1413 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-11-News flash:  Probability and statistics are hard to understand</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Two people pointed me to an article by Emre Soyer and Robin Hogarth that was  linked to  by Felix Salmon.
 
Here are my reactions: 
   
1.  Soyer and Hogarth’s paper seems very strong to me, and Salmon’s presentation is an impressive condensation of it.  I’d say good job on the science and the reporting.
 
2.  I don’t see the point of focusing on economists.  This seems just like a gimmick to me.  But, then again, I’m not an economist.  So of course I’d be more interested in a similar paper studying political scientists or statisticians.  This should be easy enough for someone to do, of course.
 
3.  To elaborate on this last point:  I’m not surprised that people, even expert practitioners, screw up with statistics.  Kahneman and Tversky found this with psychology researchers back in the 1970s.  I’m not knocking the current paper by Soyer and Hogarth but I don’t see it as surprising. Perhaps the focus on economists is what allowed it to get all this attention.  If you want people to re</p><p>5 0.69637936 <a title="991-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-01-04-%E2%80%9CDogs_are_sensitive_to_small_variations_of_the_Earth%E2%80%99s_magnetic_field%E2%80%9D.html">2159 andrew gelman stats-2014-01-04-“Dogs are sensitive to small variations of the Earth’s magnetic field”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Two different people pointed me to  this article  by Vlastimil Hart et al. in the journal Frontiers in Zoology: 
  
  
It is for the first time that (a) magnetic sensitivity was proved in dogs, (b) a measurable, predictable behavioral reaction upon natural MF fluctuations could be unambiguously proven in a mammal, and (c) high sensitivity to small changes in polarity, rather than in intensity, of MF was identified as biologically meaningful. Our findings open new horizons in magnetoreception research. Since the MF is calm in only about 20 % of the daylight period, our findings might provide an explanation why many magnetoreception experiments were hardly replicable and why directional values of records in diverse observations are frequently compromised by scatter.

<p>Introduction: In the email the other day, subject line “Casting blogger, writer, journalist to host cable series”:
  
Hi there Andrew, 


I’m casting a male journalist, writer, blogger, documentary filmmaker or comedian with a certain type personality for a television pilot along with production company, Pipeline39.  See below:


A certain type of character – no cockiness, no ego, a person who is smart, savvy, dry humor, but someone who isn’t imposing, who can infiltrate these organizations.   This person will be hosting his own show and covering alternative lifestyles and secret societies around the world.


If you’re interested in hearing more or would like to be considered for this project, please email me a photo and a bio of yourself, along with contact information. I’ll respond to you ASAP.


I’m looking forward to hearing from you.

<p>Introduction: Tapen Sinha writes:
  
Living in Mexico, I have been witness to many strange (and beautiful) things. Perhaps the strangest happened during the first outbreak of A(H1N1) in Mexico City. We had our university closed, football (soccer) was played in empty stadiums (or should it be stadia) because the government feared a spread of the virus. The Metro was operating and so were the private/public buses and taxis. Since the university was closed, we took the opportunity to collect data on facemask use in the public transport systems. It was a simple (but potentially deadly!) exercise in first hand statistical data collection that we teach our students (Although I must admit that I did not dare sending my research assistant to collect data â&euro;&ldquo; what if she contracted the virus?). I believe it was a unique experiment never to be repeated.
  
 The paper  appeared in the journal Health Policy.  From the abstract:

<p>Introduction: I think it’s part of my duty as a blogger to intersperse, along with the steady flow of jokes, rants, and literary criticism, some material that will actually be useful to you.
 
So here goes.
 
Jarno Vanhatalo, Jaakko Riihimäki, Jouni Hartikainen, Pasi Jylänki, Ville Tolvanen, and Aki Vehtari  write :
  
The  GPstuff  toolbox is a versatile collection of Gaussian process models and computational tools required for Bayesian inference. The tools include, among others, various inference methods, sparse approximations and model assessment methods.
  
We can actually now fit Gaussian processes in  Stan .  But for big problems (or even moderately-sized problems), full Bayes can be slow.  GPstuff uses EP, which is faster.  At some point we’d like to implement EP in Stan.  (Right now we’re working with Dave Blei to implement VB.)
 
GPstuff really works.  I saw Aki use it to fit a nonparametric version of the Bangladesh well-switching example in ARM.

<p>Introduction: Jelte Wicherts writes:
  
I thought you might be interested in reading  this paper  that is to appear this week in PLoS ONE.


In it we [Wicherts, Marjan Bakker, and Dylan Molenaar] show that the willingness to share data from published psychological research is associated both with “the strength of the evidence” (against H0) and the prevalence of errors in the reporting of p-values. 


The issue of data archiving will likely be put on the agenda of granting bodies and the APA/APS because of what Diederik Stapel  did .
  
I hate hate hate hate hate when people don’t share their data.  In fact, that’s the subject of my very first column on ethics for Chance magazine.  I have a story from 22 years ago, when I contacted some scientists and showed them how I could reanalyze their data more efficiently (based on a preliminary analysis of their published summary statistics).  They seemed to feel threatened by the suggestion and refused to send me their raw data.

<p>Introduction: Americans (including me) don’t know much about other countries.
 
Jeff Lax sent me to  this blog post  by Myrddin pointing out that Belgium has a higher murder rate than the rest of Western Europe.  I have no particular take on this, but it’s a good reminder that other countries differ from each other.  Here in the U.S., we tend to think all western European countries are the same, all eastern European countries are the same, etc.  In reality,  Sweden is not Finland .
 
P.S.  According to the  Wiki , Greenland is one tough town.  I guess there’s nothing much to do out there but watch satellite TV, chew the blubber, and kill people.</p><p>6 0.89912093 <a title="991-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-14-Statistics_of_food_consumption.html">413 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-14-Statistics of food consumption</a></p>

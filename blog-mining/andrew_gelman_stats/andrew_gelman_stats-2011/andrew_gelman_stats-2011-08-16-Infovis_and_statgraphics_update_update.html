</p><p>2 (c) Information visualization or infographics, as performed by graphics designers and statisticians who are particularly interested in the way that graphics can involve non-statisticians in the process of thinking about and understanding numerical data. [sent-8, score-0.949]
</p><p>3 From about 1995-2010, most of my writing on graphics focused on the contrast between (a) and (b), in particular the way that exploratory graphics could be used to check the fit of and better understand probability models. [sent-10, score-0.627]
</p><p>4 The differences between statistical graphics and information visualization are important because, on both sides, people are doing work that’s not as good as it could be. [sent-20, score-0.655]
</p><p>5 In my ignorance of the different perspectives of infographics and statistical visualization, I naively thought that the best images for the  statistical  purpose of my understanding of the data would automatically be the best for involving others. [sent-39, score-0.613]
</p><p>6 Statistical graphics people detest pie charts and tend to like plain-looking displays such as dotplots and lineplots, with even more complicated varieties such as mosaic plots looking fairly uniform from a visual perspective. [sent-47, score-0.664]
</p><p>7 Statisticians seem to care a lot about displaying data optimally but not much about what people actually learn from their graphs in real life. [sent-48, score-0.538]
</p><p>8 In contrast, infovis experts tend to like striking, unusual patterns and favor graphs with visual appeal. [sent-50, score-0.606]
</p><p>9 On one hand you have people like Cleveland, Tufte, Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, myself, and many other statisticians who want graphs to be transparent so that users can identify what each data point on the graph stands for. [sent-53, score-0.868]
</p><p>10 And somewhere on the side are the tens of millions of maybe not-so-satisfied users of Excel who are fumbling to display today’s data using last century’s tools, making graphs that hit that sweet spot of being both ugly  and  barely informative! [sent-56, score-0.665]
</p><p>11 My commenters and I suggested various alternatives; for some purposes the original graphs might be fine; the key point, though, which we should all be able to agree on, is that there are a lot of things to look for here and we shouldn’t be stuck in any single form of visual data expression. [sent-62, score-0.589]
</p><p>12 Different tastes, different goals    The main point I’ve been trying to get at in the recent discussion, starting with  my paper  with Unwin, is that it makes sense to consider the different tastes of statgraphics and infovis people as reflecting different goals. [sent-63, score-1.024]
</p><p>13 It’s not just that we statisticians are too lame to make graphs that look good, or that graphics designers are too clueless to display actual data. [sent-64, score-0.94]
</p><p>14 In contrast, graphics designers are always being made aware of the problems of getting the attention of outsiders, hence they develop tools to make graphs more impressive visually appealing. [sent-67, score-0.722]
</p><p>15 Putting it all together    Infovis people have a lot of knowledge that statisticians don’t have, ranging from technical issues of fonts and colors to a general user-focused visual and storytelling perspective. [sent-68, score-0.471]
</p><p>16 I’ve spent a lot of time in the past thirty years making graphs and thinking about making graphs. [sent-70, score-0.492]
</p><p>17 I’ve spent a lot of time in the past fifteen years or so thinking about statistical graphics as a central link connecting model building, Bayesian inference, and exploratory data analysis (in particular, check out my articles from 2003 and 2004 that I keep linking to). [sent-71, score-0.839]
</p><p>18 And I’ve spent a lot of time in the past year thinking and writing about the different goals of different practitioners of statistical graphics. [sent-72, score-0.724]
</p><p>19 I’ve tried to explore these differences by  studying some graphs that infovis proponents really seem to like :  Florence Nightingale’s plots, Yau’s 5 best data visualizations of the year, an award-winning plot from a newspaper contest, and others. [sent-75, score-0.889]
</p><p>20 I think I’ve found some common features in these graphs which might indicate some systematic differences in goals between infovis and statgraphics. [sent-76, score-0.771]

<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>3 0.47176734 <a title="855-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-10-Using_a_%E2%80%9Cpure_infographic%E2%80%9D_to_explore_differences_between_information_visualization_and_statistical_graphics.html">847 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-10-Using a “pure infographic” to explore differences between information visualization and statistical graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our discussion on data visualization continues.
 
One one side are three statisticians–Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, and myself.  We have been writing about the different goals served by information visualization and statistical graphics.
 
On the other side are graphics experts (sorry for the imprecision, I don’t know exactly what these people do in their day jobs or how they are trained, and I don’t want to mislabel them) such as  Robert Kosara  and  Jen Lowe , who seem a bit annoyed at how my colleagues and myself seem to follow the Tufte strategy of criticizing what we don’t understand.
 
And on the third side are many (most?) academic statisticians, econometricians, etc., who don’t understand or respect graphs and seem to think of visualization as a toy that is unrelated to serious science or statistics.
 
I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>4 0.38513029 <a title="855-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-19-Tradeoffs_in_information_graphics.html">1584 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-19-Tradeoffs in information graphics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The visual display of quantitative information (to use Edward Tufte’s wonderful term) is a diverse field or set of fields, and its practitioners have different goals. The goals of software designers, applied statisticians, biologists, graphic designers, and journalists (to list just a few of the important creators of data graphics) often overlap—but not completely. One of our aims in writing  our article  [on Infovis and Statistical Graphics] was to emphasize the diversity of graphical goals, as it seems to us that even experts tend to consider one aspect of a graph and not others.


Our main practical suggestion was that, in the internet age, we should not have to choose between attractive graphs and informational graphs: it should be possible to display both, via interactive displays. But to follow this suggestion, one must first accept that not every beautiful graph is informative, and not every informative graph is beautiful. . . .

<p>Introduction: By now you all must be tired of my one-sided presentations of the differences between infovis and statgraphics (for example,  this article  with Antony Unwin).
 
Today is something different.  Courtesy of Martin Theus, editor of the Statistical Computing and Graphics Newsletter, we have two short articles offering competing perspectives:
 
Robert Kosara writes from an Infovis view:
  
Information visualization is a field that has had trouble defining its boundaries, and that consequently is often misunderstood. It doesn’t help that InfoVis, as it is also known, produces pretty pictures that people like to look at and link to or send around. But InfoVis is more than pretty pictures, and it is more than statistical graphics.


The key to understanding InfoVis is to ignore the images for a moment and focus on the part that is often lost: interaction. When we use visualization tools, we don’t just create one image or one kind of visualization. In fact, most people would argue that there is</p><p>6 0.2971687 <a title="855-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-28-My_talk_on_statistical_graphics_at_Mit_this_Thurs_aft.html">1594 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-28-My talk on statistical graphics at Mit this Thurs aft</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here . Indeed, I’d much rather be a legend than a myth.
 
I just want to clarify one thing.  Walter Hickey writes:
  
[Antony Unwin and Andrew Gelman] collaborated on this presentation where they take a hard look at what’s wrong with the recent trends of data visualization and infographics.


The takeaway is that while there have been great leaps in visualization technology, some of the visualizations that have garnered the highest praises have actually been lacking in a number of key areas.


Specifically, the pair does a takedown of the top visualizations of 2008 as decided by the popular statistics blog Flowing Data.
  
This is a fair summary, but I want to emphasize that, although our dislike of some award-winning visualizations is central to our argument, it is only the first part of our story.  As Antony and I worked more on our paper, and especially after seeing the discussions by Robert Kosara, Stephen Few, Hadley Wickham, and Paul Murrell (all to appear in Journal of Computati</p><p>4 0.92179728 <a title="855-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-10-Using_a_%E2%80%9Cpure_infographic%E2%80%9D_to_explore_differences_between_information_visualization_and_statistical_graphics.html">847 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-10-Using a “pure infographic” to explore differences between information visualization and statistical graphics</a></p>

I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>5 0.91255951 <a title="855-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-29-Infovis%2C_infographics%2C_and_data_visualization%3A__Where_I%E2%80%99m_coming_from%2C_and_where_I%E2%80%99d_like_to_go.html">878 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-29-Infovis, infographics, and data visualization:  Where I’m coming from, and where I’d like to go</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I continue to struggle to convey my thoughts on statistical graphics so I’ll try another approach, this time giving my own story.
 
For newcomers to this discussion:  the background is that Antony Unwin and I wrote  an article  on the different goals embodied in information visualization and statistical graphics, but I have difficulty communicating on this point with the infovis people.
 
Maybe if I tell my own story, and then they tell their stories, this will point a way forward to a more constructive discussion.
 
So here goes. 
   
I majored in physics in college and I worked in a couple of research labs during the summer. Physicists graph everything.  I did most of my plotting on graph paper–this continued through my second year of grad school–and became expert at putting points at 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 between the x and y grid lines.
 
In grad school in statistics, I continued my physics habits and graphed everything I could.  I did notice, though, that the faculty and the other</p><p>6 0.8695395 <a title="855-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-04-%E2%80%9CWho_owns_Congress%E2%80%9D.html">319 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-04-“Who owns Congress”</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jerzy Wieczorek has an interesting  review  of the book Graph Design for the Eye and Mind by psychology researcher Stephen Kosslyn. I recommend you read all of Wieczorek’s review (and maybe Kosslyn’s book, but that I haven’t seen), but here I’ll just focus on one point. Here’s Wieczorek summarizing Kosslyn:
  

p. 18-19: the horizontal axis should be for the variable with the “most important part of the data.” See Kosslyn’s Figure 1.6 and 1.7 below. Figure 1.6 clearly shows that one of the sex-by-income groups reacts to age differently than the other three groups do. Figure 1.7 uses sex as the x-axis variable, making it much harder to see this same effect in the data. 
As a statistician exploring the data, I might make several plots using different groupings… but for communicating my results to an audience, I would choose the one plot that shows the findings most clearly.

I was thinking that you and your blog readers might be interested in “ An Economist’s Guide to Visualizing Data ” by Jonathan Schwabish, in the most recent Journal of Economic Perspectives (which is the American Economic Association’s main “outreach” journal in some ways).
  
I replied:
  
Ooh, I hate this so much!  This seems to represent a horrible example of economists not recognizing that outsiders can help them.  We do much much better in political science.
  
To which Jenkins wrote:
  
Ha! I guessed as much — hence sent it. And I’ll now admit I was surprised that JEP took the piece without getting Schwabisch to widen his reference points.
  
To elaborate a bit:  I agree with Schwabish’s general advice (“show the data,” “reduce the clutter,” and “integrate the text and the graph”).  But then he illustrates with 8 before-and-after stories in which he shows an existing graph and then gives his improvements.

<p>Introduction: Daniel Murell has more thoughts on  Turing chess  (last discussed  here ):
  
When I played with my brother, we had it that if you managed to lap someone while running around the house, then you got an additional move. This means that if you had the option to take the king on your additional move, you could, and doing so won you the game. He was fitter at the time so he slipped in two additional moves over the course of the game. I still won :) I am much better at him at chess though, so I’m sure he would have beaten me had we been more even.


W.r.t. dsquared’s  comment  and your response, I’m not overly concerned about the first move, because you can enforce that white must reach a halfway point or that some time interval elapse before black makes his first move.


This version though does have one significant weakness that is evident to me. If you wait a little for your opponent to return to make his second move in a row against you, you get your breath back.

<p>Introduction: In  this article , Oliver Sacks talks about his extreme difficulty in recognizing people (even close friends) and places (even extremely familiar locations such as his apartment and his office).
 
After reading this, I started to wonder if I have a very mild case of face-blindness.  I’m very good at recognizing places, but I’m not good at faces.  And I can’t really visualize faces at all.  Like Sacks and some of his correspondents, I often have to do it by cheating, by recognizing certain landmarks that I can remember, thus coding the face linguistically rather than visually.  (On the other hand, when thinking about mathematics or statistics, I’m very visual, as readers of this blog can attest.)
  

 
Anyway, in searching for the link to Sacks’s article, I came across the “ Cambridge Face Memory Test .”
 
My reaction when taking this test was mostly irritation.  I just found it annoying to stare at all these unadorned faces, and in my attempt to memorize them, I was trying to use trick</p><p>5 0.97123015 <a title="855-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-08-P-values_and_statistical_practice.html">1713 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-08-P-values and statistical practice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  my new article  in the journal Epidemiology:
  
Sander Greenland and Charles Poole accept that P values are here to stay but recognize that some of their most common interpretations have problems. The casual view of the P value as posterior probability of the truth of the null hypothesis is false and not even close to valid under any reasonable model, yet this misunderstanding persists even in high-stakes settings (as discussed, for example, by Greenland in 2011). The formal view of the P value as a probability conditional on the null is mathematically correct but typically irrelevant to research goals (hence, the popularity of alternative—if wrong—interpretations). A Bayesian interpretation based on a spike-and-slab model makes little sense in applied contexts in epidemiology, political science, and other fields in which true effects are typically nonzero and bounded (thus violating both the “spike” and the “slab” parts of the model).

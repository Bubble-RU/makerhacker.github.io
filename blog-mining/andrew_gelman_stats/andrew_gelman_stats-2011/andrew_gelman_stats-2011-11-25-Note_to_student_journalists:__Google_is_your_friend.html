<p>Introduction: An interview with me  from 2012 :
  
 
 
 
You’re a statistician and wrote a book,   Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State  , looking at why Americans vote the way they do. In an election year I think it would be a good time to revisit that question, not just for people in the US, but anyone around the world who wants to understand the realities – rather than the stereotypes – of how Americans vote.


I regret the title I gave my book. I was too greedy. I wanted it to be an airport bestseller because I figured there were millions of people who are interested in politics and some subset of them are always looking at the statistics. It’s got a very grabby title and as a result people underestimated the content. They thought it was a popularisation of my work, or, at best, an expansion of an article we’d written. But it had tons of original material. If I’d given it a more serious, political science-y title, then all sorts of people would have wanted to read it, because they would</p><p>3 0.21875431 <a title="1027-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-01-Why_it_can_be_rational_to_vote.html">389 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-01-Why it can be rational to vote</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think I can best do my civic duty by running this one every Election Day, just like Art Buchwald on Thanksgiving. . . .
  
With a national election coming up, and with the publicity at its maximum, now is a good time to ask, is it rational for you to vote? And, by extension, wass it worth your while to pay attention to whatever the candidates and party leaders have been saying for the  year or so? With a chance of casting a decisive vote that is comparable to the chance of winning the lottery, what is the gain from being a good citizen and casting your vote?


The short answer is, quite a lot. First the bad news. With 100 million voters, your chance that your vote will be decisive–even if the national election is predicted to be reasonably close–is, at best, 1 in a million in a battleground district and much less in a noncompetitive district such as where I live.

<p>Introduction: The other day we had a fun little discussion in  the comments section of the sister blog  about the appropriateness of stating forecast probabilities to the nearest tenth of a percentage point.
 
It started when Josh Tucker posted this graph from  Nate Silver :
 
   
 
My first reaction was:  this looks pretty but it’s hyper-precise.  I’m a big fan of Nate’s work, but all those little wiggles on the graph can’t really mean anything.  And what could it possibly mean to compute this probability to that level of precision?
 
In the comments, people came at me from two directions.  From one side, Jeffrey Friedman  expressed  a hard core attitude that it’s meaningless to give a probability forecast of a unique event:
  
What could it possibly mean, period, given that this election will never be repeated? . . . I know there’s a vast literature on this, but I’m still curious, as a non-statistician, what it could mean for there to be a meaningful 65% probability (as opposed to a non-quantifiab</p><p>6 0.17838636 <a title="1027-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-03-23-Voting_patterns_of_America%E2%80%99s_whites%2C_from_the_masses_to_the_elites.html">1227 andrew gelman stats-2012-03-23-Voting patterns of America’s whites, from the masses to the elites</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jan Vecer writes about a new voting system that is now being considered in the Czech Republic which faces a political crisis where some elected officials became corrupted: 
  
  
I came across a new suggestion about a voting system. The proposal is that in each electoral district the voter chooses 2 candidates (plus vote), but also chooses one candidate with a minus vote. Two top candidates with the highest vote count (= number of plus votes – number of minus votes) are elected to a parliament. There are 81 districts in total, the parliament would have 162 members if the proposal goes through. The intention of the negative vote is to eliminate controversial candidates. 


Are there any clear advantages over the classical “select one candidate” system? Or disadvantages?
  
Any thoughts on this?  I am not an expert on this topic but maybe some of you are.</p><p>3 0.87577981 <a title="1027-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-25-Misunderstanding_of_divided_government.html">369 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-25-Misunderstanding of divided government</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Shankar Vedantam  writes :
  
Americans distrust the GOP. So why are they voting for it? . . . Gallup tells us that 71 percent of all Americans blame Republican policies for the bad economy, while only 48 percent blame the Obama administration. . . . while disapproval of congressional Democrats stands at 61 percent, disapproval of congressional Republicans stands at 67 percent.


[But] Republicans are heavily tipped to wrest control of one or both houses of Congress from the Democrats in the upcoming midterms.
  
Hey!  I know the answer to that one.  As I  wrote  in early September:
  
 
Those 10% or so of voters who plan to vote Republican–even while thinking that the Democrats will do a better job–are not necessarily being so unreasonable. The Democrats control the presidency and both houses of Congress, and so it’s a completely reasonable stance to prefer them to the Republicans yet still think they’ve gone too far and need a check on their power.
 

 
But Vendatam thinks this expla</p><p>4 0.84216863 <a title="1027-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-01-Truth_in_headlines.html">123 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-01-Truth in headlines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I came across the following headline:
 
  
 Unemployment Extension Fails: Senate Rejects Jobless Benefits 58-38  
 

 
Actually, though, the Senate voted 58-38  in favor  of the bill.  But the opponents did a filibuster.  Here’s another try:
 
  
 Congress Fails to Pass an Extension of Jobless Aid  
 

 
But it’s still not clear that the vote was strongly in favor–not even close, in fact.  A better headline, I think, would be:
  
Senate Vote on Unemployment Extension:  58-38 in Favor, Not Enough to Beat Filibuster

<p>Introduction: I think I can best do my civic duty by running this one every Election Day, just like Art Buchwald on Thanksgiving. . . .
  
With a national election coming up, and with the publicity at its maximum, now is a good time to ask, is it rational for you to vote? And, by extension, wass it worth your while to pay attention to whatever the candidates and party leaders have been saying for the  year or so? With a chance of casting a decisive vote that is comparable to the chance of winning the lottery, what is the gain from being a good citizen and casting your vote?


The short answer is, quite a lot. First the bad news. With 100 million voters, your chance that your vote will be decisive–even if the national election is predicted to be reasonably close–is, at best, 1 in a million in a battleground district and much less in a noncompetitive district such as where I live. (The calculation is based on the chance that your district’s vote will be exactly tied, along with the chance that your di</p><p>6 0.84192139 <a title="1027-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-11-06-Why_it_can_be_rational_to_vote.html">1565 andrew gelman stats-2012-11-06-Why it can be rational to vote</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yaming Yu and Xiao-Li Meng  write in  with a cool new idea for improving the efficiency of Gibbs and Metropolis in multilevel models:
  
For a broad class of multilevel models, there exist two well-known competing parameterizations, the centered parameterization (CP) and the non-centered parameterization (NCP), for effective MCMC implementation. Much literature has been devoted to the questions of when to use which and how to compromise between them via partial CP/NCP. This article introduces an alternative strategy for boosting MCMC efficiency via simply interweaving—but not alternating—the two parameterizations. This strategy has the surprising property that failure of both the CP and NCP chains to converge geometrically does not prevent the interweaving algorithm from doing so. It achieves this seemingly magical property by taking advantage of the discordance of the two parameterizations, namely, the sufficiency of CP and the ancillarity of NCP, to substantially reduce the Markovian</p><p>2 0.89099956 <a title="1027-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-26-%E2%80%9CTo_Rethink_Sprawl%2C_Start_With_Offices%E2%80%9D.html">1029 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-26-“To Rethink Sprawl, Start With Offices”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: According to  this  op-ed by Louise Mozingo, the fashion for suburban corporate parks is seventy years old:
  
In 1942 the AT&T; Bell Telephone Laboratories moved from its offices in Lower Manhattan to a new, custom-designed facility on 213 acres outside Summit, N.J.


The location provided space for laboratories and quiet for acoustical research, and new features: parking lots that allowed scientists and engineers to drive from their nearby suburban homes, a spacious cafeteria and lounge and, most surprisingly, views from every window of a carefully tended pastoral landscape designed by the Olmsted brothers, sons of the designer of Central Park.


Corporate management never saw the city center in the same way again. Bell Labs initiated a tide of migration of white-collar workers, especially as state and federal governments conveniently extended highways into the rural edge.
  
Just to throw some Richard Florida in the mix:  Back in 1990, I  turned down  a job offer from Bell Labs, larg</p><p>same-blog 3 0.88127148 <a title="1027-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-25-Note_to_student_journalists%3A__Google_is_your_friend.html">1027 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-25-Note to student journalists:  Google is your friend</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A student journalist called me with some questions about when the U.S. would have a female president. At one point she asked if there were any surveys of whether people would vote for a woman. I suggested she try Google. I was by my computer anyway so typed “what percentage of americans would vote for a woman president” (without the quotation marks), and the very first hit was  this  from Gallup, from 2007:
  
The Feb. 9-11, 2007, poll asked Americans whether they would vote for “a generally well-qualified” presidential candidate nominated by their party with each of the following characteristics: Jewish, Catholic, Mormon, an atheist, a woman, black, Hispanic, homosexual, 72 years of age, and someone married for the third time.


 Between now and the 2008 political conventions, there will be discussion about the qualifications of presidential candidates — their education, age, religion, race, and so on. If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happene</p><p>4 0.82878911 <a title="1027-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-25-Rechecking_the_census.html">730 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-25-Rechecking the census</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sam Roberts  writes :
  
The Census Bureau [reported] that though New York City’s population reached a record high of 8,175,133 in 2010, the gain of 2 percent, or 166,855 people, since 2000 fell about 200,000 short of what the bureau itself had estimated.


Public officials were incredulous that a city that lures tens of thousands of immigrants each year and where a forest of new buildings has sprouted could really have recorded such a puny increase.


How, they wondered, could Queens have grown by only one-tenth of 1 percent since 2000? How, even with a surge in foreclosures, could the number of vacant apartments have soared by nearly 60 percent in Queens and by 66 percent in Brooklyn?
  
That does seem a bit suspicious.  So the newspaper did its own survey:
  
 
Now, a house-to-house New York Times survey of three representative square blocks where the Census Bureau said vacancies had increased and the population had declined since 2000 suggests that the city’s outrage is somewhat ju</p><p>5 0.82301927 <a title="1027-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-16-%E2%80%9CFor_individuals_with_wine_training%2C_however%2C_we_find__indications_of_a_positive_relationship_between_price_and_enjoyment%E2%80%9D.html">470 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-16-“For individuals with wine training, however, we find  indications of a positive relationship between price and enjoyment”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The title of this blog post quotes the second line of the abstract of Goldstein et al.’s much ballyhooed 2008 tech report,  Do More Expensive Wines Taste Better?  Evidence from a Large Sample of Blind Tastings .  
 
The first sentence of the abstract is
  

Individuals who are unaware of the price do not derive more enjoyment from more expensive wine.

  
Perhaps not surprisingly, given the easy target wine snobs make, the popular press has picked up on the first sentence of the tech report.  For example, the  Freakonomics blog/radio entry  of the same name quotes the first line, ignores the qualification, then concludes
  

Wishing you the happiest of holiday seasons, and urging you to spend $15 instead of $50 on your next bottle of wine. Go ahead, take the money you save and blow it on the lottery.

  
In case you’re wondering about whether to buy me a cheap or expensive bottle of wine, keep in mind I’ve had classical “wine training”.

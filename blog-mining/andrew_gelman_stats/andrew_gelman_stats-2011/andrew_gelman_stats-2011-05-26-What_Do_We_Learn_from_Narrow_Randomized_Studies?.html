</p><p>6 But in recent years, researchers have taken these theories into workplaces to measure their effect on employee behavior. [sent-9, score-0.061]
</p><p>7 In one of the first gift-exchange experiments involving “real” workers, students were employed in a six-hour library data-entry job, entering title, author, and other information from new books into a database. [sent-10, score-0.304]
</p><p>8 The pay was advertised as $12 an hour for six hours. [sent-11, score-0.231]
</p><p>9 The other half, having shown up expecting $12 an hour, were informed that they’d be paid $20 instead. [sent-13, score-0.09]

</p><p>11 The experimenters checked in every 90 minutes to tabulate how many books had been logged. [sent-15, score-0.15]
</p><p>12 At the first check-in, the $20-per-hour employees had completed more than 50 books apiece, while the $12-an-hour employees barely managed 40 each. [sent-16, score-0.715]
</p><p>13 In the second 90-minute stretch, the no-gift group maintained their 40-book pace, while the gift group fell from more than 50 to 45. [sent-17, score-0.315]
</p><p>14 For the last half of the experiment, the “gifted” employees performed no better–40 books per 90-minute period–than the “ungifted” ones. [sent-18, score-0.487]
</p><p>15 The punchline, according to Fisman:    The goodwill of high wages took less than three hours to evaporate completely–hardly a prescription for boosting long-term productivity. [sent-19, score-0.357]
</p><p>16 What I’m wondering is:  How seriously should we use an experiment on one-shot student library jobs (or another study, in which short-term employees were rewarded “with a surprise gift of thermoses”), to make general conclusions such as “Raises don’t make employees work harder.

</p><p>18 I’m not saying that the study Fisman cited is useless, just that I’m surprised that he’s so careful to consider internal validity issues yet seems to have no problem extending the result to the whole labor force. [sent-24, score-0.15]
</p><p>19 Fisman’s conclusion:    If we can find other ways of overcoming the simmering resentment that naturally accompanies wage cuts, workers themselves will be better for it in the long run. [sent-29, score-0.533]

<p>Introduction: Amy Cohen points me to  this blog  by Jim Manzi, who writes:
  
 
 Ezra Klein  and a variety of other thoughtful liberal bloggers have been pointing to an Economic Policy Institute analysis that they claim demonstrates that Wisconsin’s public employees, even after adjusting for benefits and hours worked, face a ” compensation penalty of 5% for choosing to work in the public sector.” Unfortunately, when you get under the hood, the study shows no such thing. . . . reading the  actual paper  by Jeffrey H. Keefe is instructive. Keefe took a representative sample of Wisconsin workers, and built a regression model that relates “fundamental personal characteristics and labor market skills” to compensation, and then compared public to private sector employees, after “controlling” for these factors. As far as I can see, the factors adjusted for were: years of education; years of experience; gender; race; ethnicity; disability; size of organization where the employee works; and, hours worked per</p><p>3 0.11288668 <a title="732-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-04-Write_This_Book.html">1605 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-04-Write This Book</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.     

 I’ve been preparing a review of a new statistics textbook aimed at students and practitioners in the “physical sciences,” as distinct from the social sciences and also distinct from people who intend to take more statistics courses. I figured that since it’s been years since I looked at an intro stats textbook, I should look at a few others and see how they differ from this one, so in addition to the book I’m reviewing I’ve looked at some other textbooks aimed at similar audiences: Milton and Arnold; Hines, Montgomery, Goldsman, and Borror; and a few others. I also looked at the table of contents of several more. There is a lot of overlap in the coverage of these books — they all have discussions of common discrete and continuous distributions, joint distributions, descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, linear regression, ANOVA, factorial experimental design, and a few other topics.

<p>Introduction: Andrew Perrin  nails it :
  
Twice a year, like clockwork, the ethics cops at the IRB [institutional review board, the group on campus that has to approve research involving human subjects] take a break from deciding whether or not radioactive isotopes can be administered to prison populations to cure restless-leg syndrome to dream up some fancy new way in which participating in an automated telephone poll might cause harm.
  
Perrin adds:
  
The list of exemptions to IRB review is too short and, more importantly, contains no guiding principle as to what makes exempt. . . . [and] Even exemptions require approval by the IRB.
  
He also voices a thought I’ve had many times, which is that there are all sorts of things you or I or anyone else can do on the street (for example, go up to people and ask them personal questions, drop objects and see if people pick them up, stage fights with our friends to see the reactions of bystanders, etc etc etc) but for which we have to go through an IRB</p><p>3 0.81889135 <a title="732-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-07-Challenges_of_experimental_design%3B_also_another_rant_on_the_practice_of_mentioning_the_publication_of_an_article_but_not_naming_its_author.html">399 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-07-Challenges of experimental design; also another rant on the practice of mentioning the publication of an article but not naming its author</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After learning of a  news article  by Amy Harmon on problems with medical trials–sometimes people are stuck getting the placebo when they could really use the experimental treatment, and it can be a life-or-death difference, John Langford  discusses  some fifteen-year-old work on optimal design in machine learning and makes the following completely reasonable point:
  
With reasonable record keeping of existing outcomes for the standard treatments, there is no need to explicitly assign people to a control group with the standard treatment, as that approach is effectively explored with great certainty. Asserting otherwise would imply that the nature of effective treatments for cancer has changed between now and a year ago, which denies the value of any clinical trial. . . .


Done the right way, the clinical trial for a successful treatment would start with some initial small pool (equivalent to “phase 1″ in the article) and then simply expanded the pool of participants over time as it</p><p>4 0.81426466 <a title="732-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-11-13-Ethical_concerns_in_medical_trials.html">411 andrew gelman stats-2010-11-13-Ethical concerns in medical trials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just read  this article  on the treatment of medical volunteers, written by doctor and bioethicist Carl Ellliott.
 
As a statistician who has done a small amount of consulting for pharmaceutical companies, I have a slightly different perspective.  As a doctor, Elliott focuses on individual patients, whereas, as a statistician, I’ve been trained to focus on the goal of accurately estimate treatment effects.
 
I’ll go through Elliott’s article and give my reactions.
  

 
Elliott:
  
In Miami, investigative reporters for Bloomberg Markets magazine discovered that a contract research organisation called SFBC International was testing drugs on undocumented immigrants in a rundown motel; since that report, the motel has been demolished for fire and safety violations. . . . SFBC had recently been named one of the best small businesses in America by Forbes magazine.

<p>Introduction: Atul Gawande (the thinking man’s Malcolm Gladwell)  asks :
  
Why do some innovations spread so swiftly and others so slowly? Consider the very different trajectories of surgical anesthesia and antiseptics, both of which were discovered in the nineteenth century. The first public demonstration of anesthesia was in 1846. The Boston surgeon Henry Jacob Bigelow was approached by a local dentist named William Morton, who insisted that he had found a gas that could render patients insensible to the pain of surgery. That was a dramatic claim. In those days, even a minor tooth extraction was excruciating. Without effective pain control, surgeons learned to work with slashing speed.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  hypothesizes  a “dogmatism portfolio” or a “quota of dogmatism”:  in his words,
  
If you’re very dogmatic in one area, you may be less dogmatic in others.
  
OK, well “may be” is pretty vague.  There’s not really anything to disagree with, yet.  But then Cowen continues:
  
 
There’s a lesson here.  If you wish to be a more open-minded thinker, adhere to some extreme and perhaps unreasonable fandoms, the more firmly believed the better and the more obscure the area the better.  This will help fulfill your dogmatism quota, yet without much skewing your more important beliefs.
 

 
He seems to be making a testable prediction here, that levels of dogmatism on two randomly chosen issues should be negatively correlated.  I guess I should call this “almost testable,” as it still requires an issue-by-issue measure of dogmatism.  (Is it dogmatic to believe that there was this guy called Jesus who walked on water . . . or is it dogmatic to say that Jesus  didn’t  walk on water and</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96305144 <a title="732-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-26-What_Do_We_Learn_from_Narrow_Randomized_Studies%3F.html">732 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-26-What Do We Learn from Narrow Randomized Studies?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Under the headline, “A Raise Won’t Make You Work Harder,” Ray Fisman  writes :
  
To understand why it might be a bad idea to cut wages in recessions, it’s useful to know how workers respond to changes in pay–both positive and negative changes. Discussion on the topic goes back at least as far as Henry Ford’s “5 dollars a day,” which he paid to assembly line workers in 1914. The policy was revolutionary at the time, as the wages were more than double what his competitors were paying. This wasn’t charity. Higher-paid workers were efficient workers–Ford attracted the best mechanics to his plant, and the high pay ensured that employees worked hard throughout their eight-hour shifts, knowing that if their pace slackened, they’d be out of a job. Raising salaries to boost productivity became known as “efficiency wages.”
  
So far, so good.  Fisman then moves from history and theory to recent research:

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to  this  news article by Lauren Sandler:
  
Stunningly, the postponement of marriage and parenting — the factors that shrink the birth rate — is the very best predictor of a person’s politics in the United States, over even income and education levels, a Belgian demographer named Ron Lesthaeghe [and coauthor Lisa Neidert]  has discovered . Larger family size in America correlates to early marriage and childbirth, lower women’s employment, and opposition to gay rights — all social factors that lead voters to see red.
  
All the analysis in the linked paper is at the state and county level.  That’s fine but this is not going to tell you what is a “predictor of a person’s politics.”  Cowen labels his post “Sentences to ponder,” and what I want to ponder is that people are so quick to jump from aggregate to individual patterns.
 
And, yes, I know that aggregate patterns are related to individual patterns but they’re not the same.   In particular, from the evidence we’</p><p>4 0.95428765 <a title="732-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-07-16-Hey%E2%80%93here%E2%80%99s_what_you_missed_in_the_past_30_days%21.html">805 andrew gelman stats-2011-07-16-Hey–here’s what you missed in the past 30 days!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK, the  30 days of statistics  are over.  I’ll still be posting regularly on statistical topics, but now it will be mixed in with everything else, as before.
 
Here’s what I put on the sister blogs in the past month:
 
1.  How to write  an entire report  with fake data.
 
2.  “Life getting shorter for women in hundreds of U.S. counties”:  I’d  like to see  a graph of relative change in death rates, with age on the x-axis.
 
3.   “Not a choice” != “genetic” .
 
4.  Remember when I said I’d never again post on albedo?  I was  lying .
 
5.  Update on Arrow’s theorem.  It’s  a Swiss thing , you wouldn’t understand.
 
6.  Dan Ariely can’t read, but  don’t blame  Johnson and Goldstein.
 
7.  My co-blogger endorses college scholarships for  bowling .  Which reminds me that my friends and I did “intramural bowling” in high school to get out of going to gym class.  Nobody paid us.  We even had to rent the shoes!

<p>Introduction: This article  by Thomas Crag, at Copenhagenize, is marred by reliance on old data, but it’s so full of informative graphical displays — most of them not made by the author, I think — that it’s hard to pick just one.  But here ya go. This figure shows fatalities (among cyclists) versus distance cycled, with a point for each year…unfortunately ending in way back in 1998, but still: 
   This is a good alternative to the more common choice for this sort of plot, which would be overlaying curves of fatalities vs time and distance cycled vs time.  
 
The article also explicitly discusses the fact,  previously discussed on this blog , that it’s misleading, to the point of being wrong in most contexts, to compare the safety of walking vs cycling vs driving by looking at the casualty or fatality rate  per kilometer .  Often, as in this article, the question of interest is something like, if more people switched from driving to cycling, how many more or fewer people would die?  Obviously, if peo</p><p>6 0.94782412 <a title="732-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-05-Those_darn_conservative_egalitarians.html">1444 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-05-Those darn conservative egalitarians</a></p>

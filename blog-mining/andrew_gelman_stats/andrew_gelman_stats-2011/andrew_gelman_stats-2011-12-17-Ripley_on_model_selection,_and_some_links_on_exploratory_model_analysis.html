Some of my coworkers at Facebook and I have worked with Udacity to create an online course on exploratory data analysis, including using data visualizations in R as part of EDA.


The course has now launched at  https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651  so anyone can take it for free. And Kaiser Fung has  reviewed it . So definitely feel free to promote it! Criticism is also welcome (we are still fine-tuning things and adding more notes throughout).


I wrote some more comments about the course  here , including highlighting the interviews with my great coworkers.
  
I didn’t have a chance to look at the course so instead I responded with some generic comments about eda and visualization  (in no particular order):

Chris sent me the following note:
  
I’m writing a book at the moment about reforming practices in psychological research (focusing on various bad practices such as p-hacking, HARKing, low statistical power, publication bias, lack of data sharing etc. – and posing solutions such as pre-registration, Bayesian hypothesis testing, mandatory data archiving etc.) and I am arriving at rather unsettling conclusion: that null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) simply isn’t valid for observational research. If this is true then most of the psychological literature is statistically flawed.


I was wonder what your thoughts were on this, both from a statistical point of view and from your experience working in an observational field.

<p>Introduction: Our discussion on data visualization continues.
 
One one side are three statisticians–Antony Unwin, Kaiser Fung, and myself.  We have been writing about the different goals served by information visualization and statistical graphics.
 
On the other side are graphics experts (sorry for the imprecision, I don’t know exactly what these people do in their day jobs or how they are trained, and I don’t want to mislabel them) such as  Robert Kosara  and  Jen Lowe , who seem a bit annoyed at how my colleagues and myself seem to follow the Tufte strategy of criticizing what we don’t understand.
 
And on the third side are many (most?) academic statisticians, econometricians, etc., who don’t understand or respect graphs and seem to think of visualization as a toy that is unrelated to serious science or statistics.
 
I’m not so interested in the third group right now–I tried to communicate with them in my big articles from  2003  and  2004 )–but I am concerned that our dialogue with the graphic</p><p>5 0.13591123 <a title="1066-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-08-16-Infovis_and_statgraphics_update_update.html">855 andrew gelman stats-2011-08-16-Infovis and statgraphics update update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To continue our discussion from  last week , consider three positions regarding the display of information:
 
(a) The traditional tabular approach.  This is how most statisticians, econometricians, political scientists, sociologists, etc., seem to operate.  They understand the appeal of a pretty graph, and they’re willing to plot some data as part of an exploratory data analysis, but they see their serious research as leading to numerical estimates, p-values, tables of numbers.  These people might use a graph to illustrate their points but they don’t see them as necessary in their research.
 
(b) Statistical graphics as performed by Howard Wainer, Bill Cleveland, Dianne Cook, etc.  They–we–see graphics as central to the process of statistical modeling and data analysis and are interested in graphs (static and dynamic) that display every data point as transparently as possible.

<p>Introduction: Somebody asked me to speak sometime at a data visualization meetup.  I think I spoke there a year or two ago but I could do it again.  Last time I spoke on  Infovis vs Statistical Graphics , this time I could just go thru the choices involved in a few zillion graphs I’ve published over the years, to give a sense of the options and choices involved in graphical communication.  For this talk there would be no single theme (except, perhaps, my usual “Graphs as comparisons,” “All of statistics as comparisons,” and “Exploratory data analysis as hypothesis testing”), just a bunch of open discussion about what I tried, why I tried it, what worked and what didn’t work, etc.  I’ve discussed these sorts of decisions on occasion (and am now writing a paper with Yair about some of this for our voting models), but I’ve never tried to make a talk out of it before.

<p>Introduction: Ricardo Pietrobon writes, regarding my  post  from last year on attitudes toward data graphics,
  
Wouldn’t it be the case to start formally studying the usability of graphics from a cognitive perspective? with platforms such as the mechanical turk it should be fairly straightforward to test alternative methods and come to some conclusions about what might be more informative and what might better assist in supporting decisions. btw, my guess is that these two constructs might not necessarily agree with each other.
  
And Jessica Hullman provides some background: 
  
  
Measuring success for the different goals that you hint at in your article is indeed challenging, and I don’t think that most visualization researchers would claim to have met this challenge (myself included). Visualization researchers may know the user psychology well when it comes to certain dimensions of a graph’s effectiveness (such as quick and accurate responses), but I wouldn’t agree with this statement as a gene</p><p>6 0.69410497 <a title="1066-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-09-A_tale_of_two_discussion_papers.html">1848 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-09-A tale of two discussion papers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I received the following unsolicited email, subject line “Chance Magazine – Comedy Showcase”:
  
Hi Andrew,


Hope you’re doing well.  I’m writing to let you know that we will be putting on an industry showcase at the brand new Laughing Devil Comedy Club (4738 Vernon Blvd. Long Island City) on Thursday, February 9th at 8:00 PM. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s one stop on the 7 train from Grand Central.


Following the showcase, the club will stay open for an industry mingle/happy hour with drink specials and all the business card exchanging you can hope for.


This showcase will feature 9 of our best: Steve Hofstetter’s latest album hit #1 in the world. He’ll be hosting Collin Moulton (Showtime Half Hour Special), Tony Deyo (Aspen Comedy Festival), Tom Simmons (Winner of the SF International Comedy Festival), Marc Ryan (Host of Mudslingers), Mike Trainor (TruTV), Jessi Campbell (CMT), Danny Browning (Bob & Tom), and Joe Zimmerman (Sirius/XM).


I would love for you (and anyone you’d like to</p><p>2 0.94730723 <a title="1066-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-24-Trends_in_partisanship_by_state.html">536 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-24-Trends in partisanship by state</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Yglesias  discusses  how West Virginia used to be a Democratic state but is now solidly Republican.  I thought it would be helpful to expand this to look at trends since 1948 (rather than just 1988) and all 50 states (rather than just one).  This would represent a bit of work, except that I already did it a couple years ago, so here it is (right-click on the image to see the whole thing):
  

 
 
 
I cheated a bit to get reasonable-looking groupings, for example putting Indiana in the Border South rather than Midwest, and putting Alaska in Mountain West and Hawaii in West Coast.  Also, it would help to distinguish states by color (to be able to disentangle New Jersey and Delaware, for example) but we didn’t do this because the book is mostly black and white.
 
In any case, the picture makes it clear that there have been strong regional trends all over during the past sixty years.

<p>Introduction: This  is really fun.  I love how Ripley thinks, with just about every concept considered in broad generality while being connected to real-data examples.  He’s a great statistical storyteller as well.
 
 . . . and Wickham on exploratory model analysis 
 
I came across Ripley’s slides in a reference from Hadley Wickham’s  article on exploratory model analysis .  I’ve been interested for awhile in statistical graphics for understanding fitted models (which is different than the usual use of graphics to visualize data or to understand discrepancies of data from models).  Recently I’ve started using the term “exploratory model analysis,” and it seemed like such a natural phrase that I thought I’d google it and see what’s up.  I found the above-linked paper by Hadley, which in turn refers to  a paper  by Antony Unwin, Chris Volinksy, and Sylvia Winkler that defines “exploratory modelling analysis” as “the evaluation and comparison of many models simultaneously.”  That’s not exactly what I h</p><p>4 0.93823409 <a title="1066-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-12-Sloppily-written_slam_on_moderately_celebrated_writers_is_amusing_nonetheless.html">204 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-12-Sloppily-written slam on moderately celebrated writers is amusing nonetheless</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Via  J. Robert Lennon , I discovered  this amusing blog  by Anis Shivani on “The 15 Most Overrated Contemporary American Writers.”
 
Lennon found it so annoying that he refused to even link to it, but I actually enjoyed Shivani’s bit of performance art.  The literary criticism I see is so focused on individual books that it’s refreshing to see someone take on an entire author’s career in a single paragraph.  I agree with Lennon that Shivani’s blog doesn’t have much  content –it’s full of terms such as “vacuity” and “pap,” compared to which “trendy” and “fashionable” are precision instruments–but Shivani covers a lot of ground and it’s fun to see this all in one place.
 
My main complaint with Shivani, beyond his sloppy writing (but, hey, it’s just a blog; I’m sure he saves the good stuff for his paid gigs) is his implicit assumption that everyone should agree with him.  I’m as big a Kazin fan as anyone, but I still think he completely undervalued  Marquand .

<p>Introduction: A few months ago, I  wrote :
  
Economists seem to rely heavily on a sort of folk psychology, a relic of the 1920s-1950s in which people calculate utilities (or act as if they are doing so) in order to make decisions. A central tenet of economics is that inference or policy recommendation be derived from first principles from this folk-psychology model.


This just seems silly to me, as if astronomers justified all their calculations with an underlying appeal to Aristotle’s mechanics. Or maybe the better analogy is the Stalinist era in which everything had to be connected to Marxist principles (followed, perhaps, by an equationful explanation of how the world can be interpreted as if Marxism were valid).
  
 Mark Thoma  and  Paul Krugman  seem to agree with me on this one (as does my Barnard colleague  Rajiv Sethi ).  They don’t go so far as to identify utility etc as folk psychology, but maybe that will come next.
 
P.S.  Perhaps this will clarify:  In a typical economics research pap</p><p>6 0.93466288 <a title="1066-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-26-My_talk_at_Berkeley_on_Wednesday.html">680 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-26-My talk at Berkeley on Wednesday</a></p>

By way of analogy, Bill James kicked off the modern era of baseball statistics analysis around 1975. But he stuck to doing smaller scale analyses and avoided trying to build one giant overall model for rating players. In contrast, other analysts such as Pete Palmer rushed into building overall ranking systems, such as his 1984 book, but they tended to generate curious results such as the greatness of Roy Smalley Jr.. James held off until 1999 before unveiling his win share model for overall rankings.
  
I remember looking at Pete Palmer’s book many years ago and being disappointed that he did everything through his Linear Weights formula.

I have in fact blogged on James ( many times ) and on  Paterno , so yes I think this is blogworthy.
 
On the other hand, most readers of this blog probably don’t care about baseball, football, or William James, so I’ll put the rest below the fold.
 
    
   
What is legendary baseball statistician Bill James doing, defending the crime-coverups of legendary coach Joe Paterno?  As I wrote in my earlier blog on Paterno, it isn’t always easy to do the right thing, and I have no idea if I’d behave any better if I were in such a situation.  The characteristics of a good coach do not necessarily provide what it takes to make good decisions off the field.

<p>Introduction: Someone just stopped by and dropped off a copy of the book Wizardry:  Baseball’s All-time Greatest Fielders Revealed, by Michael Humphreys.  I don’t have much to say about the topic–I did see Brooks Robinson play, but I don’t remember any fancy plays.  I must have seen Mark Belanger but I don’t really recall.  Ozzie Smith was cool but I saw only him on TV.  The most impressive thing I ever saw live was Rickey Henderson stealing a base.  The best thing about that was that everyone was expecting him to steal the base, and he still was able to do it.  But that wasn’t fielding either.
 
Anyway, Humphreys was nice enough to give me a copy of his book, and since I can’t say much (I didn’t have it in me to study the formulas in detail, nor do I know enough to be able to evaluate them), I might as well say what I can say right away.
 
(Note:  Humphreys replies to some of these questions in  a comment .)

<p>Introduction: I was recently rereading and enjoying Bill James’s Historical Baseball Abstract (the second edition, from 2001).
 
But even the Master is not perfect.  Here he is, in the context of the all-time 20th-greatest shortstop (in his reckoning):
  
Are athletes special people?  In general, no, but occasionally, yes.  Johnny Pesky at 75 was trim, youthful, optimistic, and practically exploding with energy.  You rarely meet anybody like that who  isn’t  an ex-athlete–and that makes athletes seem special. [italics in the original]
  
Hey, I’ve met 75-year-olds like that–and none of them are ex-athletes!  That’s probably because I don’t know a lot of ex-athletes.  But Bill James . . . he knows a lot of athletes.  He went to the bathroom with Tim Raines once!  The most I can say is that I saw Rickey Henderson steal a couple bases when he was playing against the Orioles once.

A hit is worth X, a walk is worth Y, etc.  Some of this is good–it’s presumably an improvement on counting walks as 0 or 1 hits, also an improvement on counting doubles and triples a</p><p>5 0.85233688 <a title="697-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-01-In_defense_of_jargon.html">440 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-01-In defense of jargon</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ben Lindbergh invited me to write an article for Baseball Prospectus.  I first sent him  this item  on the differences between baseball and politics but he said it was too political for them.  I then sent him  this review  of a book on baseball’s greatest fielders but he said they already had someone slotted to review that book.  Then I sent him some reflections on the great Bill James and  he published it !  If anybody out there knows Bill James, please send this on to him:  I have some questions at the end that I’m curious about.
 
Here’s how it begins:
  
 
I read my first Bill James book in 1984, took my first statistics class in 1985, and began graduate study in statistics the next year. Besides giving me the opportunity to study with the best applied statistician of the late 20th century (Don Rubin) and the best theoretical statistician of the early 21st (Xiao-Li Meng), going to graduate school at Harvard in 1986 gave me the opportunity to sit in a basement room one evening that</p><p>2 0.97449565 <a title="697-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-26-Antman_again_courts_controversy.html">973 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-26-Antman again courts controversy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Commenter Zbicyclist  links  to a fun  article  by Howard French on biologist E. O. Wilson:
  
Wilson announced that his new book may be his last. It is not limited to the discussion of evolutionary biology, but ranges provocatively through the humanities, as well. . . . Generation after generation of students have suffered trying to “puzzle out” what great thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Descartes had to say on the great questions of man’s nature, Wilson said, but this was of little use, because philosophy has been based on “failed models of the brain.”
  
This reminds me of my recent  remarks  on the use of crude folk-psychology models as microfoundations for social sciences.
 
The article also discusses Wilson’s recent crusade against selfish-gene-style simplifications of human and animal nature.  I’m with Wilson 100% on this one.  “Two brothers or eight cousins” is a cute line but it doesn’t seem to come close to describing how species or societies work, and it’s always seemed a</p><p>3 0.97423887 <a title="697-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-19-Thiel_update.html">525 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-19-Thiel update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A year or so ago I  discussed  the reasoning of zillionaire financier Peter Thiel, who seems to believe his own hype and, worse, seems to be able to convince reporters of his infallibility as well.  Apparently he “possesses a preternatural ability to spot patterns that others miss.”
 
More recently, Felix Salmon  commented  on Thiel’s financial misadventures:
  
Peter Thiel’s hedge fund, Clarium Capital, ain’t doing so well. Its assets under management are down 90% from their peak, and total returns from the high point are -65%.  Thiel is smart, successful, rich, well-connected, and on top of all that his calls have actually been right . . . None of that, clearly, was enough for Clarium to make money on its trades: the fund was undone by volatility and weakness in risk management.


There are a few lessons to learn here.


Firstly, just because someone is a Silicon Valley gazillionaire, or any kind of successful entrepreneur for that matter, doesn’t mean they should be trusted with oth</p><p>4 0.97036099 <a title="697-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-02-04-%E2%80%9CTurn_a_Boring_Bar_Graph_into_a_3D_Masterpiece%E2%80%9D.html">1154 andrew gelman stats-2012-02-04-“Turn a Boring Bar Graph into a 3D Masterpiece”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jimmy sends in  this .
 
   
 
Steps include “Make whimsical sparkles by drawing an ellipse using the Ellipse Tool,” “Rotate the sparkles . . . Give some sparkles less Opacity by using the Transparency Palette,” and “Add a haze around each sparkle by drawing a white ellipse using the Ellipse Tool.”
 
The punchline:
  
Now, the next time you need to include a boring graph in one of your designs you’ll be able to add some extra emphasis and get people to really pay attention to those numbers!
  
P.S. to all the commenters:  Yeah, yeah, do your contrarian best and tell me why chartjunk is actually a good thing, how I’m just a snob, etc etc.</p><p>5 0.96997821 <a title="697-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-13-Ross_Ihaka_to_R%3A__Drop_Dead.html">272 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-13-Ross Ihaka to R:  Drop Dead</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christian Robert posts  these thoughts :
  
I [Ross Ihaka] have been worried for some time that R isn’t going to provide the base that we’re going to need for statistical computation in the future. (It may well be that the future is already upon us.)  There are certainly efficiency problems (speed and memory use), but there are more fundamental issues too. Some of these were inherited from S and some are peculiar to R.

 One of the worst problems is scoping. Consider the following little gem.

 
  f =function() { 
if (runif(1) > .5) 
x = 10 
x 
} 

 

The x being returned by this function is randomly local or global. There are other examples where variables alternate between local and non-local throughout the body of a function. No sensible language would allow this.  It’s ugly and it makes optimisation really difficult.  This isn’t the only problem, even weirder things happen  because of interactions between scoping and lazy evaluation.


In light of this, I [Ihaka] have come to the c</p><p>6 0.96500504 <a title="697-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-16-Dilbert_update%3A__cartooning_can_give_you_the_strength_to_open_jars_with_your_bare_hands.html">664 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-16-Dilbert update:  cartooning can give you the strength to open jars with your bare hands</a></p>

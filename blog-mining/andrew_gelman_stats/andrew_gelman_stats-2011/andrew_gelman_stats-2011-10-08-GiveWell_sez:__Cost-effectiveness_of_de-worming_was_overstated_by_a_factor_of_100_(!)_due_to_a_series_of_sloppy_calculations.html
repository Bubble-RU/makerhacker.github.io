<p>Introduction: In a rare Christmas-themed post here, I pass along this note from Alexander Berger at  GiveWell :
  
 We just published a  blog post  following up on the *other* famous piece of evidence for deworming, the Miguel and Kremer experiment from Kenya. They shared data and code from their working paper (!) follow-up finding that deworming increases incomes ten years later, and we came out of the re-analysis feeling more confident in, though not wholly convinced by, the results. 
 We’ve also just released  our new list of top charities  for giving season this year, which I think might be a good fit for your audience. We wrote a  blog post explaining our choices , and have also published extensive reviews of the top charities and the interventions on which they work. Perhaps the most interesting change since last year is the addition of GiveDirectly in the #2 spot; they do direct unconditional cash transfers to people living on less than a dollar a day in Kenya. We think it’s a remarkable mode</p><p>3 0.092696592 <a title="947-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-02-24-%E2%80%9CEdlin%E2%80%99s_rule%E2%80%9D_for_routinely_scaling_down_published_estimates.html">2223 andrew gelman stats-2014-02-24-“Edlin’s rule” for routinely scaling down published estimates</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few months ago I  reacted  (see further discussion in comments  here ) to a recent study on early childhood intervention, in which researchers Paul Gertler, James Heckman, Rodrigo Pinto, Arianna Zanolini, Christel Vermeerch, Susan Walker, Susan M. Chang, and Sally Grantham-McGregor estimated that a particular intervention on young children had raised incomes on young adults by 42%.  I wrote:
  
Major decisions on education policy can turn on the statistical interpretation of small, idiosyncratic data sets — in this case, a study of 129 Jamaican children. . . . Overall, I have no reason to doubt the direction of the effect, namely, that psychosocial stimulation should be good. But I’m skeptical of the claim that income differed by 42%, due to the reason of  the statistical significance filter . In section 2.3, the authors are doing lots of hypothesizing based on some comparisons being statistically significant and others being non-significant. There’s nothing wrong with speculation, b</p><p>4 0.084526367 <a title="947-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-05-28-Another_argument_in_favor_of_expressing_conditional_probability_statements_using_the_population_distribution.html">56 andrew gelman stats-2010-05-28-Another argument in favor of expressing conditional probability statements using the population distribution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yesterday we had a spirited  discussion  of the following conditional probability puzzle:
  
“I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?”
  
This reminded me of the principle, familiar from  statistics instruction  and the  cognitive psychology  literature, that the best way to teach these sorts of examples is through integers rather than fractions.
 
For example, consider this classic problem:
  
“10% of persons have disease X.  You are tested for the disease and test positive, and the test has 80% accuracy.  What is the probability that you have the disease?”
  
This can be solved directly using conditional probability but it appears to be clearer to do it using integers:
  
Start with 100 people.  10 will have the disease and 90 will not.  Of the 10 with the disease, 8 will test positive and 2 will test negative.  Of the 90 without the disease, 18 will test positive and 72% will test negative.  (72% = 0.8*90.)  So, out of the origin</p><p>5 0.075446427 <a title="947-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-30-Statistical_Murder.html">1147 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-30-Statistical Murder</a></p>

…policy analyst John D. Graham and his colleagues at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis found in 1997 that the median cost for lifesaving expenditures and regulations by the U.S. government in the health care, residential, transportation, and occupational areas ranges from about $1 million to $3 million spent per life saved in today’s dollars. The only marked exception to this pattern occurs in the area of environmental health protection (such as the Superfund program) which costs about $200 million per life saved.

The US Department of Labor has described each of 807 occupations with over 200 detailed features on how jobs are done, skills required, etc.. Lee looked at seven domains of such features, each containing 16 to 57 features, and for each domain Lee did a factor analysis of those features to find the top 2-4 factors. This gave Lee a total of 22 domain factors. Lee also found four overall factors to describe his total set of 225 job and 9 demographic features. (These four factors explain 32%, 15%, 7%, and 4% of total variance.)


Lee then tried to use these 26 job factors, along with his other standard predictors (age, race, gender, m</p><p>4 0.75982094 <a title="947-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-13-You_heard_it_here_first%3A_Intense_exercise_can_suppress_appetite.html">2022 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-13-You heard it here first: Intense exercise can suppress appetite</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil Price.
 
The New York Times recently ran an article entitled  “How Exercise Can Help Us Eat Less,”  which begins with this: “Strenuous exercise seems to dull the urge to eat afterward better than gentler workouts, several new studies show, adding to a growing body of science suggesting that intense exercise may have unique benefits.” The article is based on a couple of recent studies in which moderately overweight volunteers participated in different types of exercise, and had their food intake monitored at a subsequent meal.
 
The article also says “[The volunteers] also displayed significantly lower levels of the hormone ghrelin, which is known to stimulate appetite, and elevated levels of both blood lactate and blood sugar, which have been shown to lessen the drive to eat, after the most vigorous interval session than after the other workouts. And the appetite-suppressing effect of the highly intense intervals lingered into the next day, according to food diarie</p><p>5 0.75084221 <a title="947-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-04-Massive_confusion_about_a_study_that_purports_to_show_that_exercise_may_increase_heart_risk.html">1364 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-04-Massive confusion about a study that purports to show that exercise may increase heart risk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I read  this  front-page New York Times article and was immediately suspicious.  Here’s the story (from reporter Gina Kolata):
  
Could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people? A well-known group of researchers, including one who helped write the scientific paper justifying national guidelines that promote exercise for all, say the answer may be a qualified yes.


By analyzing data from six rigorous exercise studies involving 1,687 people, the group found that about 10 percent actually got worse on at least one of the measures related to heart disease: blood pressure and levels of insulin, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. About 7 percent got worse on at least two measures. And the researchers say they do not know why.


“It is bizarre,” said Claude Bouchard, lead author of  the paper , published on Wednesday in the journal PLoS One . . .

The Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (DCP2), a major report funded by the Gates Foundation . . . provides an estimate of $3.41 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) for the cost-effectiveness of soil-transmitted-helminth (STH) treatment, implying that STH treatment is one of the most cost-effective interventions for global health. In investigating this figure, we have corresponded, over a period of months, with six scholars who had been directly or indirectly involved in the production of the estimate. Eventually, we were able to obtain the spreadsheet that was used to generate the $3.41/DALY estimate. That spreadsheet contains five separate errors that, when corrected, shift the estimated cost effectiveness of deworming from $3.41 to $326.43. [I think they mean to say $300 -- ed.] We came to this conclusion a year after learning that the DCP2’s published cost-effectiveness estimate for schistosomiasis treatment – another kind of</p><p>3 0.8582232 <a title="947-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-29-R_sucks.html">1919 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-29-R sucks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was trying to make some new graphs using 5-year-old R code and I got all these problems because I was reading in files with variable names such as “co.fipsid” and now R is automatically changing them to “co_fipsid”.  Or maybe the names had underbars all along, and the old R had changed them into dots.  Whatever.

I have measured total phosphorus, TP, on a number of dialysis patients, and also measured conventional phosphate, Pi. Now P is exchanged with the environment as Pi, so in principle a correlation between TP and Pi could perhaps be expected. I’m really most interested in the fraction of TP which is not Pi, that is TP-Pi. I would also expect that to be positively correlated with Pi. However, looking at the data using a mixed model an insignificant negative correlation is obtained. Then I thought, that since TP-Pi is bound to be small if Pi is large a negative correlation is almost dictated by the math even if the biology would have it otherwise in so far as the the TP-Pi, likely organic P, must someday have been Pi. Hence I thought about correcting the slight negative correlation between TP-Pi and Pi for the expected large negative correlation due to the math – to eventually recover what I came from: a positive correlation. People seems to agree that this thinki</p><p>5 0.84422576 <a title="947-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-13-Can_you_write_a_program_to_determine_the_causal_order%3F.html">1801 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-13-Can you write a program to determine the causal order?</a></p>

Kaggle.com has launched a  competition  to determine what’s an effect and what’s a cause. They’ve got correlated variables, they’re deprived of context, and you’re asked to determine the causal order.  $5,000 prizes.
  
I followed the link and the example they gave didn’t make much sense to me (the two variables were temperature and altitude of cities in Germany, and they said that altitude causes temperature).  It has the feeling to me of one of those weird standardized tests we used to see sometimes in school, where there’s no real correct answer so the goal is to figure out what the test-writer wanted you to say.

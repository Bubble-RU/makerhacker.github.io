Hey, wait a minute–I know Susan Assmann!  Well, I sort of know her.  When I was a freshman in college, I asked my adviser, who was an applied math prof, if I could do some research.  He connected me to Susan, who was one of his Ph.D. students, and she gave me a tiny part of her thesis to work on.
 
The problem went as follows.  You have a function f(x), for x going from 0 to infinity, that is defined as follows.  Between 0 and 1, f(x)=x.  Then, for x higher than 1, f’(x) = f(x) – f(x-1).  The goal is to figure out what f(x) does.

[sent-22, score-0.505]
</p><p>6 One of the fun things about attacking this sort of problem as a freshman is that I knew nothing about the literature on this sort of problem or even what it was called (a differential-difference equation, or it can also be formulated using as an integral). [sent-24, score-0.838]
</p><p>7 First I figured out the function in the range [1,2], [2,3], and so forth, then I made a graph (pencil on graph paper) and conjectured the asymptotic behavior of f. [sent-27, score-0.394]

</p><p>9 This accomplishment gave me a warm feeling for years after. [sent-31, score-0.133]

<p>Introduction: Scott Berry, Brad Carlin, Jack Lee, and Peter Muller recently came out with  a book  with the above title.
 
The book packs a lot into its 280 pages and is fun to read as well (even if they do use the word “modalities” in their first paragraph, and later on they use the phrase “DIC criterion,” which upsets my tidy, logical mind).  The book starts off fast on page 1 and never lets go.
 
Clinical trials are a big part of statistics and it’s cool to see the topic taken seriously and being treated rigorously.  (Here I’m not talking about empty mathematical rigor (or, should I say, “rigor”), so-called optimal designs and all that, but rather the rigor of applied statistics, mapping models to reality.)
 
Also I have a few technical suggestions.
 
1.  The authors fit a lot of models in Bugs, which is fine, but they go overboard on the WinBUGS thing.  There’s WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, JAGS:  they’re all Bugs recommend running Bugs from R using the clunky BRugs interface rather than the smoother bugs(</p><p>4 0.092896514 <a title="507-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-04-Does_it_matter_that_a_sample_is_unrepresentative%3F__It_depends_on_the_size_of_the_treatment_interactions.html">2008 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-04-Does it matter that a sample is unrepresentative?  It depends on the size of the treatment interactions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In my  article  about implausible p-values in psychology studies, I wrote:
  
“Women Are More Likely to Wear Red or Pink at Peak Fertility,” by Alec Beall and Jessica Tracy, is based on two samples: a self-selected sample of 100 women from the Internet, and 24 undergraduates at the University of British Columbia. . . .


[There is a problem with] representativeness. What color clothing you wear has a lot to do with where you live and who you hang out with. Participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students aren’t particularly representative of much more than … participants in an Internet survey and University of British Columbia students.
  
In response, I received this in an email from a prominent psychology researcher (not someone I know personally):
  
Complaining that subjects in an experiment were not randomly sampled is what freshmen do before they take their first psychology class. I really *hope* you why that is an absurd criticism – especially of au</p><p>5 0.091611579 <a title="507-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-11-05-How_much_do_we_trust_a_new_claim_that_early_childhood_stimulation_raised_earnings_by_42%25%3F.html">2090 andrew gelman stats-2013-11-05-How much do we trust a new claim that early childhood stimulation raised earnings by 42%?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hal Pashler wrote in about a  recent paper , “Labor Market Returns to Early Childhood Stimulation:  a 20-year Followup to an Experimental Intervention in Jamaica,” by Paul Gertler, James Heckman, Rodrigo Pinto, Arianna Zanolini, Christel Vermeerch, Susan Walker, Susan M. Chang, and Sally Grantham-McGregor.  Here’s Pashler:
  
Dan Willingham tweeted: @DTWillingham: RCT from Jamaica: Big effects 20 years later of intervention—teaching parenting/child stimulation to moms in poverty http://t.co/rX6904zxvN


Browsing pp. 4 ff, it seems the authors are basically saying “hey the stats were challenging, the sample size tiny, other problems, but we solved them all—using innovative methods of our own devising!—and lo and behold, big positive results!”.


So this made me think (and tweet) basically that I hope the topic (which is pretty important) will happen to interest Andy Gelman enough to incline him to give us his take.  If you happen to have time and interest…

<p>Introduction: In  this article , Oliver Sacks talks about his extreme difficulty in recognizing people (even close friends) and places (even extremely familiar locations such as his apartment and his office).
 
After reading this, I started to wonder if I have a very mild case of face-blindness.  I’m very good at recognizing places, but I’m not good at faces.  And I can’t really visualize faces at all.  Like Sacks and some of his correspondents, I often have to do it by cheating, by recognizing certain landmarks that I can remember, thus coding the face linguistically rather than visually.  (On the other hand, when thinking about mathematics or statistics, I’m very visual, as readers of this blog can attest.)
  

 
Anyway, in searching for the link to Sacks’s article, I came across the “ Cambridge Face Memory Test .”
 
My reaction when taking this test was mostly irritation.  I just found it annoying to stare at all these unadorned faces, and in my attempt to memorize them, I was trying to use trick</p><p>3 0.79695135 <a title="507-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-02-05-Glenn_Hubbard_and_I_were_on_opposite_sides_of_a_court_case_and_I_didn%E2%80%99t_even_know_it%21.html">1707 andrew gelman stats-2013-02-05-Glenn Hubbard and I were on opposite sides of a court case and I didn’t even know it!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matt Taibbi  writes :
  
Glenn Hubbard, Leading Academic and Mitt Romney Advisor, Took $1200 an Hour to Be Countrywide’s Expert Witness . . . Hidden among the reams of material recently filed in connection with the lawsuit of monoline insurer MBIA against Bank of America and Countrywide is a deposition of none other than Columbia University’s Glenn Hubbard. . . . Hubbard testified on behalf of Countrywide in the MBIA suit. He conducted an “analysis” that essentially concluded that Countrywide’s loans weren’t any worse than the loans produced by other mortgage originators, and that therefore the monstrous losses that investors in those loans suffered were due to other factors related to the economic crisis – and not caused by the serial misrepresentations and fraud in Countrywide’s underwriting.

<p>Introduction: Gregory Eady writes:
  
I’m working on a paper examining the effect of superpower alliance on a binary DV (war). I hypothesize that the size of the effect is much higher during the Cold War than it is afterwards. I’m going to run a Chow test to check whether this effect differs significantly between 1960-1989 and 1990-2007 (Scott Long also has a method using predicted probabilities), but I’d also like to show the trend graphically, and thought that your “Secret Weapon” would be useful here. I wonder if there is anything I should be concerned about when doing this with a (rare-events) logistic regression. I was thinking to graph the coefficients in 5-year periods, moving a single year at a time (1960-64, 1961-65, 1962-66, and so on), reporting the coefficient in the graph for the middle year of each 5-year range).
  
My reply:
 
I don’t know nuthin bout no Chow test but, sure, I’d think the secret weapon would work.

<p>Introduction: When I was a kid I took a writing class, and one of the assignments was to write a 1-to-2 page story.  I can’t remember what I wrote, but I do remember the following story from one of the other kids.  In its entirety:
  
I snuck into this pay toilet and I can’t get out!
  
In the discussion period, the kid explained that his original idea was a story explaining the character’s situation, how he got into this predicament and how he got stuck.  But then he (the author) realized that the one sentence captured the whole story, there was really no need to elaborate.
 
(To understand the above story, you have to know the following historical fact:  Pay toilets in the U.S., decades ago, were  not  the high-security objects shown (for example) in the picture above.  Rather, they were implemented via coin-operated locks on individual toilet stalls.  So it really would be possible to sneak into certain pay toilets, if you were willing to crawl under the door or climb over it.)

<p>Introduction: A colleague recently sent me a copy of some articles on the estimation of treatment interactions (a topic that’s interested me for awhile).  One of the articles, which appeared in the Lancet in 2000, was called “ Subgroup analysis and other (mis)uses of baseline data in clinical trials ,” by Susan F. Assmann, Stuart J. Pocock, Laura E. Enos, and Linda E. Kasten. . . . 
 
Hey, wait a minute–I know Susan Assmann!  Well, I sort of know her.  When I was a freshman in college, I asked my adviser, who was an applied math prof, if I could do some research.  He connected me to Susan, who was one of his Ph.D. students, and she gave me a tiny part of her thesis to work on.
 
The problem went as follows.  You have a function f(x), for x going from 0 to infinity, that is defined as follows.  Between 0 and 1, f(x)=x.  Then, for x higher than 1, f’(x) = f(x) – f(x-1).  The goal is to figure out what f(x) does.  I think I’m getting this right here, but I might be getting confused on some of the detai</p><p>2 0.99847949 <a title="507-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-23-Christakis_response_to_my_comment_on_his_comments_on_social_science_%28or_just_skip_to_the_P.P.P.S._at_the_end%29.html">1952 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-23-Christakis response to my comment on his comments on social science (or just skip to the P.P.P.S. at the end)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, Nicholas Christakis  wrote  an article in the newspaper criticizing academic social science departments:
  
The social sciences have stagnated. . . . This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . . I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class. There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics. And repeatedly observing these phenomena does not help us fix them.
  
I  disagreed , saying that Christakis wasn’t giving social science research enough credit:
  
I’m no economist so I can let others discuss the bit about “monopoly power is bad for markets.” I assume that the study by</p><p>3 0.99812686 <a title="507-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-30-More_on_the_correlation_between_statistical_and_political_ideology.html">638 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-30-More on the correlation between statistical and political ideology</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a chance for me to combine two of my interests–politics and statistics–and probably to irritate both halves of the readership of this blog.  Anyway…
 
I recently  wrote  about the apparent correlation between Bayes/non-Bayes statistical ideology and liberal/conservative political ideology:
  
The Bayes/non-Bayes fissure had a bit of a political dimension–with anti-Bayesians being the old-line conservatives (for example, Ronald Fisher) and Bayesians having a more of a left-wing flavor (for example, Dennis Lindley). Lots of counterexamples at an individual level, but my impression is that on average the old curmudgeonly, get-off-my-lawn types were (with some notable exceptions) more likely to be anti-Bayesian.
  
This was somewhat based on my experiences at Berkeley.  Actually, some of the cranky anti-Bayesians were probably Democrats as well, but when they were being anti-Bayesian they seemed pretty conservative.

<p>Introduction: Xian points me to  an article  by retired college professor David Rubinstein who argues that college professors are underworked and overpaid:
  
After 34 years of teaching sociology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I [Rubinstein] recently retired at age 64 at 80 percent of my pay for life. . . . But that’s not all: There’s a generous health insurance plan, a guaranteed 3 percent annual cost of living increase, and a few other perquisites. . . . I was also offered the opportunity to teach as an emeritus for three years, receiving $8,000 per course . . . which works out to over $200 an hour. . . .
  
You will perhaps not be surprised to hear that I had two immediate and opposite reactions to this:
 
1.  Hey–somebody wants to cut professors’ salaries.  Stop him!
 
2.  Hey–this guy’s making big bucks and doesn’t do any work–that’s not fair!  (I  went online  to find David Rubinstein’s salary but it didn’t appear in the database.

I have followed your thoughts on plagiarism rather closely, and I ran across something in the Economics literature that I felt might interest you (and if you were to share this, I’d rather remain anonymous as a junior faculty not looking to step on toes anywhere).  I know you aren’t the plagiarism police, but figured you would have some input.


I’ve been reading up on some literature regarding all-pay auctions for some research I have been working on and came across an interesting paper in J. Political Economy (1998) with the following intro:

 
“Many economic allocations are decided by competition for a prize on the basis of costly activities. For example, monopoly licenses may be awarded to the person (or group) that lobbies the hardest (Tullock, 1967), or tickets may be given to those who wait in line the longest (Holt and Sherman 1982). In such contests, losers’ efforts are costly and are generally not compensated.

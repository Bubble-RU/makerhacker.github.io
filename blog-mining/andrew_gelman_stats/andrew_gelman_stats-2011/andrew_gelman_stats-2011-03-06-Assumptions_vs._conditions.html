A link to an  article , “Four Assumptions Of Multiple Regression That Researchers Should Always Test”, has been making  the rounds  on Twitter.  Their first rule is “Variables are Normally distributed.”  And they seem to be talking about the independent variables – but then later bring in tests on the residuals (while admitting that the normally-distributed error assumption is a weak assumption).  


I thought we had long-since moved away from transforming our independent variables to make them normally distributed for statistical reasons (as opposed to standardizing them for interpretability, etc.)  Am I missing something?  I agree that leverage in a influence is important, but normality of the variables? The article is from 2002, so it might be dated, but given the popularity of the tweet, I thought I’d ask your opinion.
  
My response:  There’s some useful advice on that page but overall I think the advice was dated even in 2002.

Psychology students (and probably students in other disciplines) are often taught that in order to perform ‘parametric’ tests, e.g. independent t-test, the data for each group need to be normally distributed. However, in literature (and various university lecture notes and slides accessible online), I have come across at least 4 different interpretation of what it is that is supposed to be normally distributed when doing a t-test:


1. population 
2. sampled data for each group 
3. distribution of estimates of means for each group 
4. distribution of estimates of the difference between groups


I can see how 2 would follow from 1 and 4 from 3 but even then, there are two different sets of interpretations of the normality assumption. 
Could you please put this issue to rest for me?
  
My quick response is that normality is  not so important  unless you are focusing on prediction.</p><p>4 0.17499557 <a title="602-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-07-Assumptions_vs._conditions%2C_part_2.html">603 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-07-Assumptions vs. conditions, part 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In response to the  discussion  of his remarks on assumptions vs. conditions, Jeff Witmer  writes :
  
If [certain conditions hold] , then the t-test p-value gives a remarkably good approximation to “the real thing” — namely the randomization reference p-value. . . .





I [Witmer] make assumptions about conditions that I cannot check, e.g., that the data arose from a random sample. Of course, just as there is no such thing as a normal population, there is no such thing as a random sample.
  
I disagree strongly with both the above paragraphs!  I say this not to pick a fight with Jeff Witmer but to illustrate how, in statistics, even the most basic points that people take for granted, can’t be.
 
Let’s take the claims in order:

<p>Introduction: Elias Bareinboim asked what I thought about  his comment  on selection bias in which he referred to a  paper  by himself and Judea Pearl, “Controlling Selection Bias in Causal Inference.”
 
I replied that I have no problem with what he wrote, but that from my perspective I find it easier to conceptualize such problems in terms of multilevel models. I elaborated on that point in a  recent post , “Hierarchical modeling as a framework for extrapolation,” which I think was read by only a few people (I say this because it received only two comments).
 
I don’t think Bareinboim objected to anything I wrote, but like me he is comfortable working within his own framework.  He wrote the following to me: 
  
  
In some sense, “not ad hoc” could mean logically consistent.

Larry Wasserman, “Low Assumptions, High Dimensions”:
 
This article was refreshing to me because it was so different from anything I’ve seen before.  Larry works in a statistics department and I work in a statistics department but there’s so little overlap in what we do.  Larry and I both work in high dimesions (maybe his dimensions are higher than mine, but a few thousand dimensions seems like a lot to me!), but there the similarity ends.  His article is all about using few to no assumptions, while I use assumptions all the time.  Here’s an example.  Larry writes:

I think I am having an existential crisis.


I used to work with animals (rats, mice, gerbils etc.) Then I started to work in marketing research where we did have some kind of random sampling procedure. So up until a few years ago, I was sort of okay.


Now I am teaching marketing research, and I feel like there is no real random sampling anymore. I take pains to get students to understand what random means, and then the whole lot of inferential statistics.  Then almost anything they do – the sample is not random. They think I am contradicting myself.  They use convenience samples at every turn – for their school work, and the enormous amount on online surveying that gets done. Do you have any suggestions for me?


Other than say, something like  this .

I have a problem very similar to the one presented chapter 6 of BDA, the speed of light example. You use the distribution of the minimum scores from the posterior predictive distribution, show that it’s not realistic given the data, and suggest that an asymmetric contaminated normal distribution or a symmetric long-tailed distribution would be better.


How does one use such a distribution?
  
My reply:
 
You can actually use a symmetric long-tailed distribution such as t with low degrees of freedom.  One striking feature of symmetric long-tailed distributions is that a small random sample from such a distribution can have outliers on one side or the other and look asymmetric.
 
Just to see this, try the following in R: 
  
par (mfrow=c(3,3), mar=c(1,1,1,1)) 
for (i in 1:9) hist (rt (100, 2), xlab="", ylab="", main="")

<p>Introduction: Several years ago, I heard about a project at the Educational Testing Service to  identify “strivers”:  students from disadvantaged backgrounds who did unexpectedly well on the SAT (the college admissions exam formerly known as the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” but apparently now just “the SAT,” in the same way that Exxon is just “Exxon” and that Harry Truman’s middle name is just “S”), at least 200 points above a predicted score based on demographic and neighborhood information.  My ETS colleague and I agreed that this was a silly idea:  From a statistical point of view, if student A is expected ahead of time to do better than student B, and then they get identical test scores, then you’d expect student A (the non-”striver”) to do better than student B (the “striver”) later on.  Just basic statistics:  if a student does much better than expected, then probably some of that improvement is noise.  The idea of identifying these “strivers” seemed misguided and not the best use of the SAT.</p><p>2 0.92665744 <a title="602-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-04-%E2%80%9CDon%E2%80%99t_think_of_it_as_duplication._Think_of_it_as_a_single_paper_in_a_superposition_of_two_quantum_journals.%E2%80%9D.html">1654 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-04-“Don’t think of it as duplication.

<p>Introduction: Adam Marcus at Retraction Watch  reports  on a physicist at the University of Toronto who had this unfortunate thing happen to him:
  
This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief and first and corresponding author.


The article was largely a duplication of a paper that had already appeared in ACS Nano, 4 (2010) 3374–3380, http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/nn100335g.


The first and the corresponding authors (Kramer and Sargent) would like to apologize for this administrative error on their part . . .
  
“Administrative error” . . . I love that!  Is that what the robber says when he knocks over a liquor store and gets caught?  As Marcus points out, the two papers have different titles and a different order of authors, which makes it less plausible that this was an administrative mistake (as could happen, for example, if a secretary was given a list of journals to submit the paper to, and accidentally submitted it to the second journal on the list without realizing it</p><p>same-blog 3 0.92603952 <a title="602-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-06-Assumptions_vs._conditions.html">602 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-06-Assumptions vs. conditions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Witmer writes:
  
I noticed that you continue the standard practice in statistics of referring to assumptions; e.g. a blog entry on 2/4/11 at 10:54: “Our method, just like any model, relies on assumptions which we have the duty to state and to check.”


I’m in the 6th year of a three-year campaign to get statisticians to drop the word “assumptions” and replace it with “conditions.”  The problem, as I see it, is that people tend to think that an assumption is something that one assumes, as in “assuming that we have a right triangle…” or “assuming that k is even…” when constructing a mathematical proof.  


But in statistics we don’t assume things — unless we have to.  Instead, we know that, for example, the validity of a t-test depends on normality, which is a condition that can and should be checked.  Let’s not call normality an assumption, lest we imply that it is something that can be assumed.  Let’s call it a condition.
  
What do you all think?</p><p>4 0.92323768 <a title="602-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-13-Data_sharing_update.html">1055 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-13-Data sharing update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fred Oswald reports that Sian Beilock sent him sufficient amounts of raw data from  her research study  so allow him to answer his questions about the large effects that were observed.  This sort of collegiality is central to the collective scientific enterprise.
 
The bad news is that IRB’s are still getting in the way.  Beilock was very helpful but she had to work within the constraints of her IRB, which apparently advised her not to share data—even if de-identified—without getting lots more permissions.
 
Oswald writes:
  
It is a little concerning that the IRB bars the sharing of de-identified data, particularly in light of the  specific guidelines  of the journal Science, which appears to say that when you submit a study to the journal for publication, you are allowing for the sharing of de-identified data — unless you expressly say otherwise at the point that you submit the paper for consideration.
  
Again, I don’t blame Beilock and Ramirez—they appear to have been as helpful as</p><p>5 0.92063016 <a title="602-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-31-Just_gave_a_talk.html">2275 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-31-Just gave a talk</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just gave a talk in Milan.  Actually I was sitting at my desk, it was a g+ hangout which was a bit more convenient for me.  The audience was a bunch of astronomers so I figured they could handle a satellite link. . . . 
 
Anyway, the talk didn’t go so well.  Two reasons:  first, it’s just hard to get the connection with the audience without being able to see their faces.  Next time I think I’ll try to get several people in the audience to open up their laptops and connect to the hangout, so that I can see a mosaic of faces instead of just a single image from the front of the room.
 
The second problem with the talk was the topic.  I asked the people who invited me to choose a topic, and they picked  Can we use Bayesian methods to resolve the current crisis of statistically-significant research findings that don’t hold up?   But I don’t think this was right for this audience.  I think that it would’ve been better to give them  the Stan talk  or  the little data talk  or  the statistic</p><p>6 0.91815937 <a title="602-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-01-29-G%2B_%3E_Skype.html">1143 andrew gelman stats-2012-01-29-G+ > Skype</a></p>

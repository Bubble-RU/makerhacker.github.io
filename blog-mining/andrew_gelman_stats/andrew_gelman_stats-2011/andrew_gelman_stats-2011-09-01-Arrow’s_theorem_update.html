<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, I am fascinated by academic and scientific cheating and the  excuses  people give for it.
 
 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>3 0.31503755 <a title="883-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-26-Musical_chairs_in_econ_journals.html">371 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-26-Musical chairs in econ journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a paper  by Bruno Frey on the lack of space for articles in economics journals.  Frey writes:
  
To further their careers, [academic economists] are required to publish in A-journals, but for the vast majority this is impossible because there are few slots open in such journals. Such academic competition maybe useful to generate hard work, however, there may be serious negative consequences: the wrong output may be produced in an inefficient way, the wrong people may be selected, and losers may react in a harmful way.
  
According to Frey, the consensus is that there are only five top economics journals–and one of those five is Econometrica, which is so specialized that I’d say that, for most academic economists, there are only four top places they can publish.  The difficulty is that demand for these slots outpaces supply:  for example, in 2007 there were only 275 articles in all these journals combined (or 224 if you exclude Econometrica), while “a rough estim</p><p>4 0.26591155 <a title="883-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-12-The_importance_of_style_in_academic_writing.html">902 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-12-The importance of style in academic writing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In my comments on  academic cheating , I briefly discussed the question of how some of these papers could’ve been published in the first place, given that they tend to be of low quality.  (It’s rare that people plagiarize the good stuff, and, when they do—for example when a senior scholar takes credit for a junior researcher’s contributions without giving proper credit—there’s not always a paper trail, and there can be legitimate differences of opinion about the relative contributions of the participants.)
 
Anyway, to get back to the cases at hand:  how did these rulebreakers get published in the first place?  The question here is not how did they get away with cheating but how is it that top journals were publishing mediocre research? 
   
In the case of the profs who falsified data (Diederik Stapel) or did not follow scientific protocol (Mark Hauser), the answer is clear:  By cheating, they were able to get the sort of too-good-to-be-true results which, if they  were  true, would be</p><p>5 0.25439543 <a title="883-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-22-Arrow%E2%80%99s_other_theorem.html">675 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-22-Arrow’s other theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who’d like to remain anonymous:
  
Lately I [the anonymous correspondent] witnessed that Bruno Frey has published two articles in two well known referreed journals on the Titanic disaster that try to explain survival rates of passenger on board.


The articles were published in the  Journal of Economic Perspectives  and  Rationality & Society .  While looking up the name of the second journal where I stumbled across the article I even saw that they put the message in a third journal, the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America .


To say it in Sopranos like style – with all due respect, I know Bruno Frey from conferences, I really appreciate his take on economics as a social science and he has really published  more interesting stuff that most economists ever will. But putting the same message into three journals gives me headaches for at least two reasons:

<p>Introduction: I’ve whined before in this space that some of my most important, innovative, and influential papers are really hard to get published.  I’ll go through endless hassle with a journal or sometimes several journals until I find some place willing to publish.  It’s just irritating.
 
I was thinking about this recently because a colleague and I just finished a paper that I love love love.  But I can’t figure out where to submit it.  This is a paper for which I would prefer the so-called reverse-journal-submission approach.  Instead of sending the paper to journal after journal after journal, waiting years until an acceptance (recall that, unless you’re Bruno Frey, you’re not allowed to submit the same paper to multiple journals simultaneously), you post the paper on a public site, and then journals compete to see who gets to publish it.  I think that system would work well with a paper like this which is offbeat but has a nontrivial chance of becoming highly influential.

<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>5 0.87373894 <a title="883-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-06-How_to_think_about_papers_published_in_low-grade_journals%3F.html">1928 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-06-How to think about papers published in low-grade journals?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We’ve had lots of lively discussions of fatally-flawed papers that have been published in top, top journals such as the  American Economic Review  or the  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology  or the  American Sociological Review  or the  tabloids .  And we also know about mistakes that make their way into mid-ranking outlets such as the Journal of Theoretical Biology.
 
But what about results that appear in the lower tier of legitimate journals?  I was thinking about this after reading a  post  by Dan Kahan slamming a paper that recently appeared in PLOS-One.  I won’t discuss the paper itself here because that’s not my point.  Rather, I had some thoughts regarding Kahan’s annoyance that a paper with fatal errors was published at all.

<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this letter  to Bruno Frey from the editor of the Journal of Economic Perspectives.  ( Background here , also  more here  from Olaf Storbeck.)  The journal editor was upset about Frey’s self-plagiarism, and Frey responded with an apology:
  
It was a grave mistake on our part for which we deeply apologize. It should never have happened. This is deplorable. . . . Please be assured that we take all precautions and measures that this unfortunate event does not happen again, with any journal.
  
What I wonder is:  How “deplorable” does Frey really think this is?  You don’t publish a paper in 5 different places by accident!  Is Frey saying that he knew this was deplorable back then and he did it anyway, based on calculation balancing the gains from multiple publications vs. the potential losses if he got caught?  Or is he saying that the conduct is deplorable, but he didn’t realize it was deplorable when he did it?
 
My guess is that Frey does not actually think the r</p><p>2 0.88800204 <a title="883-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-10-%E2%80%9CProposition_and_experiment%E2%80%9D.html">1797 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-10-“Proposition and experiment”</a></p>

I. Many people will not, of their own accord, look at a poem.


II. Millions of people will, of their own accord, spend lots and lots of time looking at photographs of cats.


III. Therefore, earlier this year, I concluded that the best strategy for increasing the number of viewers for poems would be to print them on top of photographs of cats.


IV. I happen to like looking at both poems and cats.


V. So this is, for me, a win-win situation.


VI. Fortunately, my own cat is a patient model, and (if I am to be believed) quite photogenic.


VII. The aforementioned cat is Tisko Tansi, small hero.


VII. Thus I present to you (albeit in digital rather than physical form) an Endearments broadside, featuring a poem that originally appeared in BlazeVOX spring 2011.

<p>Introduction: [Update: Revised given comments from Wingfeet, Andrew and germo.  Thanks!  I'd mistakenly translated the dlnorm priors in the first version --- amazing what a difference the priors make.  I also escaped the less-than and greater-than signs in the constraints in the model so they're visible.  I also updated to match the thin=2 output of JAGS.]
 
We’re going to be starting a Stan “model of the P” (for some time period P) column, so I thought I’d kick things off with one of my own.  I’ve been following the  Wingvoet blog , the author of which is identified only by the Blogger handle  Wingfeet ;  a couple of days ago this lovely post came out:
  
  PK calculation of IV and oral dosing in JAGS 
   
Wingfeet’s post implemented an answer to question 6 from chapter 6 of problem from Rowland and Tozer’s 2010 book,   Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  , Fourth edition, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins.   
 
So in the grand tradition of using this blog to procrastinate, I thought I’d t</p><p>4 0.88335669 <a title="883-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-30-Stan_is_fast.html">1476 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-30-Stan is fast</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Washington Post and Slate reporter Anne Applebaum wrote a  dismissive  column about Wikileaks, saying that they “offer nothing more than raw data.”
 
Applebaum argues that “The notion that the Internet can replace traditional news-gathering has just been revealed to be a myth. . . . without more journalism, more investigation, more work, these documents just don’t matter that much.”
 
Fine.  But don’t undervalue the role of mere data!  The usual story is that we  don’t  get to see the raw data underlying newspaper stories.  Wikileaks and other crowdsourced data can be extremely useful, whether or not they replace “traditional news-gathering.”</p><p>6 0.84654343 <a title="883-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-25-Who_gets_wedding_announcements_in_the_Times%3F.html">370 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-25-Who gets wedding announcements in the Times?</a></p>

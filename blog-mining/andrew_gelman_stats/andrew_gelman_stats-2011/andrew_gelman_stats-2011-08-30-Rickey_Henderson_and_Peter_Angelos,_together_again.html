Kasparov we all know about.  I still remember how he pulled out a victory in  the last game of his tournament with Karpov.  Just amazing:  he had to win the game, a draw would not be enough.  Both players knew that Kasparov had to win.  And he did it.  A feat as impressive as Kirk Gibson’s off-the-bench game-winning home run in the 1987 Series.

That is soooo true.  I’m excellent at parsing sentences but I’m not so great at chess.  And, worse than that, my chess ability seems to be declining from year to year.
 
Which reminds me:  I recently read Frank Brady’s much lauded  Endgame , a biography of Bobby Fischer.  The first few chapters were great, not just the Cinderella story of his steps to the world championship, but also the background on his childhood and the stories of the games and tournaments that he lost along the way.
 
But after Fischer beats Spassky in 1972, the book just dies.  Brady has chapter after chapter on Fisher’s life, his paranoia, his girlfriends, his travels.  But, really, after the chess is over, it’s just sad and kind of boring.

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  reviews  a recent book, “Lifecyle Investing,” by Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff, two professors of management at Yale.  The book recommends that young adults take out loans to buy stocks and then hold these stocks for many years to prepare for retirement.
 
What I’m wondering is:  What’s the goal of writing this sort of book?  The main audience has got to be young adults (and their parents) who are already pretty well fixed, financially.  Students at Yale, for example.  And the book must be intended for people who are already beyond the standard recommendations of personal-investment books (pay off your credit card debt, don’t waste so much money on restaurant meals and fancy clothes, buy 1 used car instead of 2 new ones, etc).  Basically it sounds like they’re talking to people who have a lot of money but want to make sure that they retire rich rather than merely middle-class.
 
I can’t say that I’m morally opposed to helping the rich get richer.

<p>Introduction: I was playing out a chess game from the newspaper and we reminded how the best players use the entire board in their game.  In my own games (I’m not very good, I’m guessing my “rating” would be something like 1500?), the action always gets concentrated on one part of the board.  Grandmaster games do get focused on particular squares of the board, of course, but, meanwhile, there are implications in other places and the action can suddenly shift.</p><p>6 0.65850717 <a title="881-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-16-Chess_vs._checkers.html">615 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-16-Chess vs. checkers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Today I was reminded of a riddle from junior high: 
Q:  What do you get when you cross an elephant with peanut butter? 
A:  Peanut butter that never forgets, or an elephant that sticks to the roof of your mouth.
 
The occasion was a  link  from Tyler Cowen to a new book by Garry Kasparov and . . . Peter Thiel.
 
Kasparov we all know about.  I still remember how he pulled out a victory in  the last game of his tournament with Karpov.  Just amazing:  he had to win the game, a draw would not be enough.  Both players knew that Kasparov had to win.  And he did it.  A feat as impressive as Kirk Gibson’s off-the-bench game-winning home run in the 1987 Series.
 
Peter Theil is a more obscure figure.  He’s been featured a  couple  of  times  on this blog and comes across as your typical overconfident rich dude.
 
It’s an odd combination, sort of like what you might get if Rickey Henderson and Peter Angelos were to write a book about how to reform baseball.  Cowen writes, “How can I not pre-orde</p><p>2 0.83046907 <a title="881-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-12-17-Why_a_bonobo_won%E2%80%99t_play_poker_with_you.html">473 andrew gelman stats-2010-12-17-Why a bonobo won’t play poker with you</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sciencedaily has posted an article titled  Apes Unwilling to Gamble When Odds Are Uncertain :
  

The apes readily distinguished between the different probabilities of winning: they gambled a lot when there was a 100 percent chance, less when there was a 50 percent chance, and only rarely when there was no chance In some trials, however, the experimenter didn’t remove a lid from the bowl, so the apes couldn’t assess the likelihood of winning a banana The odds from the covered bowl were identical to those from the risky option: a 50 percent chance of getting the much sought-after banana. But apes of both species were less likely to choose this ambiguous option.

   

Like humans, they showed “ambiguity aversion” — preferring to gamble more when they knew the odds than when they didn’t. Given some of the other differences between chimps and bonobos, Hare and Rosati had expected to find the bonobos to be more averse to ambiguity, but that didn’t turn out to be the case.

<p>Introduction: Hear me interviewed on the topic  here .
 
P.S.  The interview was fine but I donâ&euro;&trade;t agree with everything on the linked website.  For example,  this  bit:
  
Global warming is not the first case of a widespread fear based on incomplete knowledge turned out to be false or at least greatly exaggerated.  Global warming has many of the characteristics of a popular delusion, an irrational fear or cause that is embraced by millions of people because, well, it is believed by millions of people!
  
All right, then.</p><p>6 0.72842252 <a title="881-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-04-45%25_hitting%2C_25%25_fielding%2C_25%25_pitching%2C_and_100%25_not_telling_us_how_they_did_it.html">942 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-04-45% hitting, 25% fielding, 25% pitching, and 100% not telling us how they did it</a></p>

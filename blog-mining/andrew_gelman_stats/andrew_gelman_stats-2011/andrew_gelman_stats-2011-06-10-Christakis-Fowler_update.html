<p>Introduction: Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler are famous for finding that obesity is contagious.  Their claims, which have been received with both respect and skepticism (perhaps we need a new word for this:  “respecticism”?) are based on analysis of data from the Framingham heart study, a large longitudinal public-health study that happened to have some social network data (for the odd reason that each participant was asked to provide the name of a friend who could help the researchers locate them if they were to move away during the study period.
 
The short story is that if your close contact became obese, you were likely to become obese also.  The long story is a debate about the reliability of this finding (that is, can it be explained by measurement error and sampling variability) and its causal implications.
 
This sort of study is in my wheelhouse, as it were, but I have never looked at the Christakis-Fowler work in detail.  Thus, my previous and current comments are more along the line</p><p>3 0.36673856 <a title="756-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-01-31-Fowlerpalooza%21.html">1699 andrew gelman stats-2013-01-31-Fowlerpalooza!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Russ Lyons points us to  a discussion in Statistics in Medicine  of the  famous claims  by Christakis and Fowler on the contagion of obesity etc.
 
 
 
 James O’Malley  and  Christakis and Fowler  present the positive case.
 
 Andrew Thomas  and  Tyler VanderWeele  present constructive criticism.
 
Christakis and Fowler  reply .
 
Coincidentally, a couple weeks ago an epidemiologist was explaining to me the differences between the Framingham Heart Study and the Nurses Health Study and why Framingham got the postmenopausal supplement risks right while Nurses got it wrong.
 
P.S.  The journal issue also includes a comment on “A distribution-free test of constant mean in linear mixed effects models.”  Wow!  I had no idea people still did this sort of thing.  How horrible.  But I guess that’s what half-life is all about.  These ideas last forever, they just become less and less relevant to people.</p><p>4 0.36257049 <a title="756-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-10-More_questions_on_the_contagion_of_obesity%2C_height%2C_etc..html">1412 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-10-More questions on the contagion of obesity, height, etc.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: AT  discusses  [link broken; see P.P.S. below] a new paper of his that casts doubt on the robustness of the  controversial  Christakis and Fowler papers.  AT writes that he ran some simulations of contagion on social networks and found that (a) in a simple model assuming the contagion of the sort hypothesized by Christakis and Fowler, their procedure would indeed give the sorts of estimates they found in their papers, but (b) in another simple model assuming a different sort of contagion, the C&F; estimation would give indistinguishable estimates.  Thus, if you believe AT’s simulation model, C&F;’s procedure cannot statistically distinguish between two sorts of contagion (directional and simultaneous).
 
I have not looked at AT’s paper so I can’t fully comment, but I don’t fully understand his method for simulating network connections.  AT uses what he calls a “rewiring” model.  This makes sense:  as time progresses, we make new friends and lose old ones—but I am confused by the details</p><p>5 0.24657957 <a title="756-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-07-23-Christakis_response_to_my_comment_on_his_comments_on_social_science_%28or_just_skip_to_the_P.P.P.S._at_the_end%29.html">1952 andrew gelman stats-2013-07-23-Christakis response to my comment on his comments on social science (or just skip to the P.P.P.S. at the end)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, Nicholas Christakis  wrote  an article in the newspaper criticizing academic social science departments:
  
The social sciences have stagnated. . . . This is not only boring but also counterproductive, constraining engagement with the scientific cutting edge and stifling the creation of new and useful knowledge. . . . I’m not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class. There are diminishing returns from the continuing study of many such topics. And repeatedly observing these phenomena does not help us fix them.

I will restrict my discussion to social science examples. Social scientists are often tempted to illustrate their ideas with examples from medical research. When it comes to medicine, though, we are, with rare exceptions, at best ignorant laypersons (in my case, not even reaching that level), and it is my impression that by reaching for medical analogies we are implicitly trying to borrow some of the scientific and cultural authority of that field for our own purposes.

The social sciences have stagnated. They offer essentially the same set of academic departments and disciplines that they have for nearly 100 years: sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology and political science.

<p>Introduction: After I  posted on  Russ Lyons’s criticisms of the work of Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler’s work on social networks, several people emailed in with links to related articles.  (Nobody wants to comment on the blog anymore; all I get is emails.)
 
Here they are:
  

 
Political scientists Hans Noel and Brendan Nyhan wrote  a paper  called “The ‘Unfriending’ Problem: The Consequences of Homophily in Friendship Retention for Causal Estimates of Social Influence” in which they argue that the Christakis-Fowler results are subject to bias because of patterns in the time course of friendships.
 
Statisticians Cosma Shalizi and AT wrote  a paper  called “Homophily and Contagion Are Generically Confounded in Observational Social Network Studies” arguing that analyses such as those of Christakis and Fowler cannot hope to disentangle different sorts of network effects.
 
And Christakis and Fowler reply to Noel and Nyhan, Shalizi and Thomas, Lyons, and others in  an article  that begins:

<p>Introduction: Cassie Murdoch  points  to a  report  from a corporate survey:
  
Sixty-two percent of U.S. employees say it’s not likely they or a family member will be diagnosed with a serious illness like cancer, a survey indicates.


The Aflac WorkForces Report, a survey of nearly 1,900 benefits decision-makers and more than 6,100 U.S. workers, also indicated 55 percent said they were not very or not at all likely to be diagnosed with a chronic illness, such as heart disease or diabetes.
  
Here are some actual statistics:
  
The American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts & Figures 2012, said 1-in-3 women and 1-in-2 men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, and the National Safety Council, Injury Facts 2011 edition, says more than 38.9 million injuries occur in a year requiring medical treatment.


The American Heart Association, Heart Disease & Stroke Statistics 2012, said 1-in-6 U.S. deaths were caused by coronary heart disease, Tillman said.
  
And some details on the survey:</p><p>3 0.99770844 <a title="756-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-08-03-Climate_Change_News.html">180 andrew gelman stats-2010-08-03-Climate Change News</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I. State of the Climate report   
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently released their  “State of the Climate Report” for 2009 .  The report has chapters discussing global climate (temperatures, water vapor, cloudiness, alpine glaciers,…); oceans (ocean heat content, sea level, sea surface temperatures, etc.); the arctic (sea ice extent, permafrost, vegetation, and so on); Antarctica (weather observations, sea ice extent,…), and regional climates. 
 
NOAA also provides  a nice page  that lets you display any of 11 relevant time-series datasets (land-surface air temperature, sea level, ocean heat content, September arctic sea-ice extent, sea-surface temperature, northern hemisphere snow cover, specific humidity, glacier mass balance, marine air temperature, tropospheric temperature, and stratospheric temperature).  Each of the plots overlays data from several databases (not necessarily indepenedent of each other), and you can select which ones to include or leave</p><p>4 0.99718964 <a title="756-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-01-The_%E2%80%9Ccushy_life%E2%80%9D_of_a_University_of_Illinois_sociology_professor.html">740 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-01-The “cushy life” of a University of Illinois sociology professor</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Xian points me to  an article  by retired college professor David Rubinstein who argues that college professors are underworked and overpaid:
  
After 34 years of teaching sociology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I [Rubinstein] recently retired at age 64 at 80 percent of my pay for life. . . . But that’s not all: There’s a generous health insurance plan, a guaranteed 3 percent annual cost of living increase, and a few other perquisites. . . . I was also offered the opportunity to teach as an emeritus for three years, receiving $8,000 per course . . . which works out to over $200 an hour. . . .
  
You will perhaps not be surprised to hear that I had two immediate and opposite reactions to this:
 
1.  Hey–somebody wants to cut professors’ salaries.  Stop him!
 
2.  Hey–this guy’s making big bucks and doesn’t do any work–that’s not fair!  (I  went online  to find David Rubinstein’s salary but it didn’t appear in the database.  So I did the next best thing and looked up the sala</p><p>5 0.99568361 <a title="756-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-13-A_survey%E2%80%99s_not_a_survey_if_they_don%E2%80%99t_tell_you_how_they_did_it.html">761 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-13-A survey’s not a survey if they don’t tell you how they did it</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since we’re on  the topic  of nonreplicable research . . . see  here  (link from  here ) for a story of a survey that’s so bad that the people who did it won’t say how they did it.
 
I know too many cases where people screwed up in a survey when they were actually trying to get the right answer, for me to trust any report of a survey that doesn’t say what they did.
 
I’m reminded of  this survey  which may well have been based on a sample of size 6 (again, the people who did it refused to release any description of methodology).</p><p>6 0.99563646 <a title="756-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-06-17-Graphical_tools_for_understanding_multilevel_models.html">772 andrew gelman stats-2011-06-17-Graphical tools for understanding multilevel models</a></p>

</p><p>7 After the babies, the married brain has better things to do–micromanage, focus on those babies, create comfort zones. [sent-11, score-0.164]

</p><p>9 Then maybe you’re burrowing through the skin and just to the surface of the bone, I guess. [sent-15, score-0.131]
</p><p>10 It seems like a wasted opportunity, really:  this dude could’ve shared insights from his research and discussed its applicability (or the limitations of its applicability) to love, a topic that everybody cares about. [sent-16, score-0.29]
</p><p>11 (In contrast,  another  interview in this Economists in Love series, by Daniel Hamermesh, was much more to the point. [sent-17, score-0.187]

</p><p>14 Yes, I realize it’s supposed to be self-deprecating, but to me it comes off as self-deprecating along the lines of, “Yeah, my cat’s much smarter than I am. [sent-20, score-0.158]

</p><p>16 I’m more worried about the hidden assumptions that can sap one’s research, as well as the ways in which subtle and interesting ideas in psychology can become entangled with various not-so-subtle, not-so-well-thought-out ideas on sex roles etc. [sent-24, score-0.174]
</p><p>17 I’m being completely unfair to Camerer    I have no idea how this interview was conducted but it could well have been done over the phone in ten minutes. [sent-25, score-0.349]
</p><p>18 Basically, Camerer is a nice guy and when these reporters called him up to ask him some questions, he said, Sure, why not. [sent-26, score-0.079]

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to an interview with economists Ronald Coase and Ning Wang:
  
We are now working with the University of Chicago Press to launch a new journal, Man and the Economy. We chose our title carefully to signal the mission of the new journal, which is to restore economics to a study of man as he is and of the economy as it actually exists.
  
“We chose our title carefully,” indeed.

One thing about being an economist, it gives you the ability to describe yourself as “one of the world’s leading experts on psychology.”

<p>Introduction: I was invited by the Columbia University residence halls to speak at an event on gay marriage.  (I’ve assisted my colleagues Jeff Lax and Justin Phillips in their research on the topic.)  The event sounded fun–unfortunately I’ll be out of town that weekend so can’t make it–but it got me thinking about how gay marriage and other social issues are so relaxing to think about because there’s no need for doubt.
 
About half of Americans support same-sex marriage and about half oppose it.  And the funny thing is, you can be absolutely certain in your conviction, from either direction.  If you support, it’s a simple matter of human rights, and it’s a bit ridiculous to suppose that if gay marriage is allowed, it will somehow wreck all the straight marriages out there.  Conversely, you can oppose on the clear rationale of wanting to keep marriage the same as it’s always been, and suggest that same-sex couples can be free to get together outside of marriage, as they always could.

<p>Introduction: Gayle Laackmann  reports  ( link  from Felix Salmon) that Microsoft, Google, etc. don’t actually ask brain-teasers in their job interviews.  The actually ask a lot of questions about programming.  (I looked  here  and was relieved to see that the questions aren’t very hard.  I could probably get a job as an entry-level programmer if I needed to.)
 
Laackmann writes:
  
Let’s look at the very widely circulated “15 Google Interview Questions that will make you feel stupid” list [ here's the original list , I think, from Lewis Lin] . . . these questions are fake. Fake fake fake.  How can you tell that they’re fake?  Because one of them is “Why are manhole covers round?”  This is an infamous Microsoft interview question that has since been so very, very banned at both companies .  I find it very hard to believe that a Google interviewer asked such a question.
  
We’ll get back to the manhole question in a bit.

<p>Introduction: In response to my most recent  post  expressing bafflement over the Erving Goffman mystique, several commenters helped out by suggesting classic Goffman articles for me to read.  Naturally, I followed the  reference  that had a link attached–it was for an article called Cooling the Mark Out, which analogized the frustrations of laid-off and set-aside white-collar workers to the reactions to suckers after being bilked by con artists.
 
Goffman’s article was fascinating, but I was bothered by a tone of smugness. Here’s a quote from Cooling the Mark Out that starts on the cute side but is basically ok:
  
In organizations patterned after a bureaucratic model, it is customary for personnel to expect rewards of a specified kind upon fulfilling requirements of a specified nature. Personnel come to define their career line in terms of a sequence of legitimate expectations and to base their self-conceptions on the assumption that in due course they will be what the institution allows persons t</p><p>4 0.77759022 <a title="594-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-04-29-The_Great_Race.html">1831 andrew gelman stats-2013-04-29-The Great Race</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Phil.
 
Last summer my wife and I took a 3.5-month vacation that included a wide range of activities. When I got back, people would ask “what were the highlights or your trip?”, and I was somewhat at a loss: we had done so many things that were so different, many of which seemed really great…how could I pick? Someone said, wisely, that in six months or a year I’d be able to answer the question because some memories would be more vivid than others. They were right, and I was recently thinking back on our vacation and putting together a list of highlights — enjoyable in itself, but also worth doing to help plan future vacations.
 
One of the things we did was go to four evenings of track and field events at the London Olympics. After we got back, people would ask what we had seen at the Olympics.

<p>Introduction: Last night I spoke at the Columbia Club of New York, along with some of my political science colleagues, in a  panel  about politics, the economy, and the forthcoming election.  The discussion was fine . . . until one guy in the audience accused us of bias based on what he imputed as our ethnicity.  One of the panelists replied by asking the questioner what of all the things we had said was biased, and the questioner couldn’t actually supply any examples.
 
It makes sense that the questioner couldn’t come up with a single example of bias on our part, considering that we were actually presenting  facts .
 
At some level, the questioner’s imputation of our ethnicity and accusation of bias isn’t so horrible.  When talking with my friends, I engage in casual ethnic stereotyping all the time–hey, it’s a free country!–and one can certainly make the  statistical  argument that you can guess people’s ethnicities from their names, appearance, and speech patterns, and in turn you can infer a lot</p><p>6 0.77118659 <a title="594-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-05-Wacky_interview_questions%3A__An_exploration_into_the_nature_of_evidence_on_the_internet.html">505 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-05-Wacky interview questions:  An exploration into the nature of evidence on the internet</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This  was just bizarre.  It’s an interview with Colin Camerer, a professor of finance and economics at Caltech, The topic is Camerer’s marriage, but what’s weird is that he doesn’t say anything specific about his wife at all.  All we get are witticisms of the sub-Henny-Youngman level, for example, in response to the question, “Any free riding in your household?”, Camerer says:
  
No. Here’s why: I am one of the world’s leading experts on psychology, the brain and strategic game theory. But my wife is a woman. So it’s a tie.
  
Also some schoolyard evolutionary biology (“men signaling that they will help you raise your baby after conception, and women signaling fidelity” blah blah blah) and advice for husbands in “upper-class marriages with assets.”  (No advice to the wives, but maybe that’s a good thing.)  And here are his insights on love and marriage:
  
Marriage is like hot slow-burning embers compared to the flashy flames of love. After the babies, the married brain has better thin</p><p>2 0.91281414 <a title="594-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-09-26-Difficulties_in_making_inferences_about_scientific_truth_from_distributions_of_published_p-values.html">2040 andrew gelman stats-2013-09-26-Difficulties in making inferences about scientific truth from distributions of published p-values</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Leek  just posted  the discussions of his paper (with Leah Jager), “An estimate of the science-wise false discovery rate and application to the top medical literature,” along with some further comments of his own.
 
 Here  are my original thoughts on an earlier version of their article.  Keith O’Rourke and I expanded these thoughts into  a formal comment  for the journal.  We’re pretty much in agreement with John Ioannidis (you can find his discussion in the top link above).
 
In quick summary, I agree with Jager and Leek that this is an important topic.  I think there are two key places where Keith and I disagree with them:
 
1.  They take published p-values at face value whereas we consider them as the result of a complicated process of selection.  This is something I didn’t used to think much about, but now I’ve become increasingly convinced that the problems with published p-values is not a simple file-drawer effect or the case of a few p=0.051 values nudged toward p=0.049, bu</p><p>3 0.90816087 <a title="594-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-02-Theoretical_vs_applied_statistics.html">498 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-02-Theoretical vs applied statistics</a></p>

I was wondering if you could provide me with some guidance regarding statistical training. My background is in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, with an emphasis on Quantitative Psychology and currently working in the employee selection industry. I am considering pursuing a masters degree in Statistics. As l look through several program options, I am curious about the real difference between theoretical and applied Statistics. It would be very enlightening if you could shed some light on the difference. Specifically:


1. Is theoretical side more mathematically oriented (i.e., theorems and proofs) than applied?


2. Are the skills acquired in a ‘theoretical’ class difficult to transfer to the ‘applied’ side and vice versa?


3. I see theoretical statistics as the part that engages in developing the methods and applied statistics as pure application of the methods. Is this perception completely off base?

<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  points  to an interview with economists Ronald Coase and Ning Wang:
  
We are now working with the University of Chicago Press to launch a new journal, Man and the Economy. We chose our title carefully to signal the mission of the new journal, which is to restore economics to a study of man as he is and of the economy as it actually exists.
  
“We chose our title carefully,” indeed.
 
I’m reminded of a bizarrely-retro  remark  from a couple years ago by Colin (“at age 22″) Camerer.  In response to the question, “Any free riding in your household?”, Camerer said:
  
No. Here’s why: I am one of the world’s leading experts on psychology, the brain and strategic game theory. But my wife is a woman. So it’s a tie.
  
One thing about being an economist, it gives you the ability to describe yourself as “one of the world’s leading experts on psychology.”

<p>Introduction: Deborah Mayo pointed me to  this discussion  by Christian Hennig of my recent  article  on Induction and Deduction in Bayesian Data Analysis.
 
A couple days ago I  responded  to comments by Mayo, Stephen Senn, and Larry Wasserman.  I will respond to Hennig by pulling out paragraphs from his discussion and then replying.
 
Hennig:
  
for me the terms “frequentist” and “subjective Bayes” point to interpretations of probability, and not to specific methods of inference. The frequentist one refers to the idea that there is an underlying data generating process that repeatedly throws out data and would approximate the assumed distribution if one could only repeat it infinitely often.
  
Hennig makes the good point that, if this is the way you would define “frequentist” (it’s not how I’d define the term myself, but I’ll use Hennig’s definition here), then it makes sense to be a frequentist in some settings but not others.

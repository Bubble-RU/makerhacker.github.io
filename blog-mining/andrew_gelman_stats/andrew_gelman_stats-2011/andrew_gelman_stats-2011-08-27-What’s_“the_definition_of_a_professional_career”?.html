The old liberal slogan always demanded that we “treat teachers like professionals.” That entails some measure of accountability—we can debate the metrics—which allows both that very bad teachers be fired and that very good ones can obtain greater pay and recognition.

<p>Introduction: Following up on our  discussion  of professionalism (in which Jonathan Chait argued that “the definition of a professional career track” requires pay differentials and the chance to get fired, and I argued the opposite, that a lot of people go into professional careers specifically because of the job security), Austin Frakt pointed me to  this description  of professionalism from Go master Toshiro Kageyama.
 
This in turn reminds me of a remark of Bill James when he explained lack of surprise that clutch hitting does not show up in the data.  He wrote that the underlying idea of clutch hitting is that a player will play particuarly well in an important situation where the game or the season is on the line.  But, James pointed out, these guys are pros, and the true sign of a professional is that he can always stay concentrated.
 
This argument applies particuarly for hitting, maybe less so for pitching, where a pitcher can’t necessarily throw his hardest for 100 pitches in a game.</p><p>3 0.20850155 <a title="874-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-11-Jonathan_Chait_and_I_agree_about_the_importance_of_the_fundamentals_in_determining_presidential_elections.html">656 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-11-Jonathan Chait and I agree about the importance of the fundamentals in determining presidential elections</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Johathan Chait  writes :
  
 Parties and candidates will kill themselves to move the needle a percentage point or two in a presidential race. And again, the fundamentals determine the bigger picture, but within that big picture political tactics and candidate quality still matters around the margins. 
  
I agree completely.  This is the central message of Steven Rosenstone’s excellent 1983 book, Forecasting Presidential Elections.
 
So, given that Chait and I agree 100%, why was I  so upset  at his recent  column  on “The G.O.P.’s Dukakis Problem”?
 
I’ll put the reasons for my displeasure below the fold because my main point is that I’m happy with Chait’s quote above.  For completeness I want to explain where I’m coming from but my take-home point is that we’re mostly in agreement.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Chait  writes  that the most important aspect of a presidential candidate is “political talent”:
  
Republicans have generally understood that an agenda tilted toward the desires of the powerful requires a skilled frontman who can pitch Middle America. Favorite character types include jocks, movie stars, folksy Texans and war heroes. . . . [But the frontrunners for the 2012 Republican nomination] make Michael Dukakis look like John F. Kennedy. They are qualified enough to serve as president, but wildly unqualified to run for president. . . . [Mitch] Daniels’s drawbacks begin — but by no means end — with his lack of height, hair and charisma. . . . [Jeb Bush] suffers from an inherent branding challenge [because of his last name]. . . . [Chris] Christie . . . doesn’t cut a trim figure and who specializes in verbally abusing his constituents. . . .  [Haley] Barbour is the comic embodiment of his party’s most negative stereotypes.

<p>Introduction: We have a new “ Objects of the class ,” and it’s a good one!
 
Here’s what happened.  I came across a thoughtful  discussion  by Mark Palko of how it was that Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ticked off so many people with his recent remarks about “white suburban moms”:
  
To understand why Duncan hit such a nerve, you need to consider the long and complicated role that racial politics have played in this debate.


The public face of the education reform movement has always been pictures of eager young African-American and Hispanic children. Not only has the movement been sold as a way of helping these children but people who object to parts of the reform agenda have often been accused, implicitly or explicitly, of not wanting to help children of color. . . . For starters, with certain notable exceptions, the leaders of the reform movement tend to be white or Asian . . . By comparison, the tenured and/or unionized teachers who have paid the highest price in terms of policy changes an</p><p>3 0.76067233 <a title="874-lsi-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-23-The_scalarization_of_America.html">533 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-23-The scalarization of America</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Palko  passes  this  one  along from high school principal Carol Burris:
  
My music teacher, Doreen, brought me her second-grade daughter’s math homework.  She was already fuming over  Education Secretary Arne Duncan ’s remark about why “white suburban moms” oppose the Common Core, and the homework added fuel to the fire. The problem that disturbed her the most was the following:

 
3. Sally did some counting. Look at her work. Explain why you think Sally counted this way.


177, 178, 179, 180, 190, 200, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214.
 

It was on a homework sheet from the New York State Common Core Mathematics Curriculum for Grade 2,  which you can find here . 
Doreen’s daughter had no idea how to answer this odd question.
  
I’m with Doreen’s daughter on this one.  Actually, it’s worse than that.  I clicked on the link, searched on *Sally* to check that the problem was really there as stated, then I looked at the two previous problems:

<p>Introduction: Last month I  expressed disagreement  the following statement from New Republic columnist Jonathan Chait, who wrote:
  
The old liberal slogan always demanded that we “treat teachers like professionals.” That entails some measure of accountability—we can debate the metrics—which allows both that very bad teachers be fired and that very good ones can obtain greater pay and recognition. That’s the definition of a professional career track . . .
  
I was surprised to find the option of being fired as part of the definition of professionalism, and I conjectured that journalists, who currently have  little job security  could feel resentful toward teachers and other workers who have the expectation of jobs for life.  (As Mark Palko  notes , “we’re talking about reneging on assurances of job security that were contractual agreed upon and came after a period of proven performance.”)
 
In an update ( link  from Palko), Chait  writes :

<p>Introduction: I just wanted to add the above comment to Bob’s  notes  on language.  Spoken (and, to some extent, handwritten) language can be much more expressive than the typed version.
 
I’m not just talking about slang or words such as baaaaad; I’m also talking about pauses that give logical structure to a sentence.  For example, sentences such as “The girl who hit the ball where the dog used to be was the one who was climbing the tree when the dog came by” are effortless to understand in speech but can be difficult for a reader to follow.  Often when I write, I need to untangle my sentences to keep them readable.</p><p>3 0.93490404 <a title="874-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-11-Math_Talks_%3A%3A_Action_Movies.html">1617 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-11-Math Talks :: Action Movies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Goodman  gave the  departmental seminar  yesterday (10 Dec 2012) and I was amused by an extended analogy he made.  After his (very clear) intro, he said that math talks were like action movies.

<p>Introduction: Cameron McKenzie writes:
  
I ran into  the attached paper  [by Dave Marcotte and Sara Markowitz] on the social benefits of prescription of psychotropic drugs, relating a drop in crime rate to an increase in psychiatric drug prescriptions. It’s not my area (which is psychophysics) but I do find this kind of thing interesting. Either people know much more than I think they do, or they are pretending to, and either is interesting. My feeling is that it doesn’t pass the sniff test, but I wondered if you might (i) find the paper interesting and/or (ii) perhaps be interested in commenting on it on the blog. It seems to me that if we cumulated all econometric studies of crime rate we would be able to explain well over 100% of the variation therein, but perhaps my skepticism is unwarranted.

I know what you mean.  The story seems plausible but the statistical analysis seems like a stretch.

<p>Introduction: My short answer (based on the research of Leighley and Nagler):
  
Whether or not mandatory voting is a good idea, I think it’s unlikely to happen at a national level. Even setting aside the practical difficulties of taking a now-voluntary action and making it compulsory, bringing in the other half of the potential electorate would change the political conversation so much that it’s hard for me to see current officeholders supporting such a plan.

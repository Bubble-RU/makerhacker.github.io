<p>Introduction: As regular readers of this blog are aware, I am fascinated by academic and scientific cheating and the  excuses  people give for it.
 
 Bruno Frey  and colleagues published a single article (with only minor variants) in five different major journals, and these articles did not cite each other.  And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>3 0.26591155 <a title="902-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-01-Arrow%E2%80%99s_theorem_update.html">883 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-01-Arrow’s theorem update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone pointed me to  this letter  to Bruno Frey from the editor of the Journal of Economic Perspectives.  ( Background here , also  more here  from Olaf Storbeck.)  The journal editor was upset about Frey’s self-plagiarism, and Frey responded with an apology:
  
It was a grave mistake on our part for which we deeply apologize. It should never have happened. This is deplorable. . . . Please be assured that we take all precautions and measures that this unfortunate event does not happen again, with any journal.
  
What I wonder is:  How “deplorable” does Frey really think this is?  You don’t publish a paper in 5 different places by accident!  Is Frey saying that he knew this was deplorable back then and he did it anyway, based on calculation balancing the gains from multiple publications vs. the potential losses if he got caught?  Or is he saying that the conduct is deplorable, but he didn’t realize it was deplorable when he did it?
 
My guess is that Frey does not actually think the r</p><p>4 0.262068 <a title="902-tfidf-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-22-Arrow%E2%80%99s_other_theorem.html">675 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-22-Arrow’s other theorem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I received the following email from someone who’d like to remain anonymous:
  
Lately I [the anonymous correspondent] witnessed that Bruno Frey has published two articles in two well known referreed journals on the Titanic disaster that try to explain survival rates of passenger on board.


The articles were published in the  Journal of Economic Perspectives  and  Rationality & Society .  While looking up the name of the second journal where I stumbled across the article I even saw that they put the message in a third journal, the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences United States of America .


To say it in Sopranos like style – with all due respect, I know Bruno Frey from conferences, I really appreciate his take on economics as a social science and he has really published  more interesting stuff that most economists ever will. But putting the same message into three journals gives me headaches for at least two reasons:


1) When building a track record and scientific rep</p><p>5 0.25584888 <a title="902-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-05-20-What_happened_that_the_journal_Psychological_Science_published_a_paper_with_no_identifiable_strengths%3F.html">1865 andrew gelman stats-2013-05-20-What happened that the journal Psychological Science published a paper with no identifiable strengths?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day we  discussed  that paper on ovulation and voting (you may recall that the authors reported a scattered bunch of comparisons, significance tests, and p-values, and I recommended that they would’ve done better to simply report complete summaries of their data, so that readers could see the comparisons of interest in full context), and I was thinking a bit more about why I was so bothered that it was published in Psychological Science, which I’d thought of as a serious research journal. 
   
My concern isn’t just that that the paper is bad—after all, lots of bad papers get published—but rather that it had nothing really going for it,  except  that it was headline bait.  It was a survey done on Mechanical Turk, that’s it.  No clever design, no clever questions, no care in dealing with nonresponse problems, no innovative data analysis, no nothing.  The paper had nothing to offer, except that it had no obvious flaws.  Psychology is a huge field full of brilliant researchers.</p><p>6 0.24882865 <a title="902-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-03-12-More_on_publishing_in_journals.html">2245 andrew gelman stats-2014-03-12-More on publishing in journals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Stan Liebowitz writes:
  
Have you ever heard of an article being retracted in economics? I know you have only been doing this for a few years but I suspect that the answer is that none or very few are retracted. No economist would ever deceive another. There is virtually no interest in detecting cheating. And what good would that do if there is no form of punishment? I say this because I think I have found a case in one of our top journals but the editor allowed the authors of the original article to write an anonymous referee report defending themselves and used this report to reject my comment even though an independent referee recommended publication.
  
My reply:  I wonder how this sort of thing will change in the future as journals become less important.  My impression is that, on one side, researchers are increasingly citing NBER reports, Arxiv preprints, and the like; while, from the other direction, journals such as Science and Nature are developing the reputations of being “t</p><p>4 0.84046596 <a title="902-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-26-Musical_chairs_in_econ_journals.html">371 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-26-Musical chairs in econ journals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tyler Cowen  links  to  a paper  by Bruno Frey on the lack of space for articles in economics journals.  Frey writes:
  
To further their careers, [academic economists] are required to publish in A-journals, but for the vast majority this is impossible because there are few slots open in such journals. Such academic competition maybe useful to generate hard work, however, there may be serious negative consequences: the wrong output may be produced in an inefficient way, the wrong people may be selected, and losers may react in a harmful way.
  
According to Frey, the consensus is that there are only five top economics journals–and one of those five is Econometrica, which is so specialized that I’d say that, for most academic economists, there are only four top places they can publish.  The difficulty is that demand for these slots outpaces supply:  for example, in 2007 there were only 275 articles in all these journals combined (or 224 if you exclude Econometrica), while “a rough estim</p><p>5 0.83707041 <a title="902-lsi-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-09-12-Some_thoughts_on_academic_cheating%2C_inspired_by_Frey%2C_Wegman%2C_Fischer%2C_Hauser%2C_Stapel.html">901 andrew gelman stats-2011-09-12-Some thoughts on academic cheating, inspired by Frey, Wegman, Fischer, Hauser, Stapel</a></p>

And there have been several other cases of his self-plagiarism (see  this review  from Olaf Storbeck).  I do not mind the general practice of repeating oneself for different audiences—in the social sciences, we call this  Arrow’s Theorem —but in this case Frey seems to have gone a bit too far.  Blogger Economic Logic has  looked into  this and concluded that this sort of common practice is standard in “the context of the German(-speaking) academic environment,” and what sets Frey apart is not his self-plagiarism or even his brazenness but rather his practice of doing it in high-visibility journals.  Economic Logic writes that “[Frey's] contribution is pedagogical, he found a good and interesting</p><p>6 0.82262862 <a title="902-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-22-Arrow%E2%80%99s_other_theorem.html">675 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-22-Arrow’s other theorem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In my comments on  academic cheating , I briefly discussed the question of how some of these papers could’ve been published in the first place, given that they tend to be of low quality.  (It’s rare that people plagiarize the good stuff, and, when they do—for example when a senior scholar takes credit for a junior researcher’s contributions without giving proper credit—there’s not always a paper trail, and there can be legitimate differences of opinion about the relative contributions of the participants.)
 
Anyway, to get back to the cases at hand:  how did these rulebreakers get published in the first place?  The question here is not how did they get away with cheating but how is it that top journals were publishing mediocre research? 
   
In the case of the profs who falsified data (Diederik Stapel) or did not follow scientific protocol (Mark Hauser), the answer is clear:  By cheating, they were able to get the sort of too-good-to-be-true results which, if they  were  true, would be</p><p>2 0.96352232 <a title="902-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-06-W%E2%80%99man_%3C_W%E2%80%99pedia%2C_again.html">945 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-06-W’man < W’pedia, again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Blogger Deep Climate  looks at  another paper by the 2002 recipient of the American Statistical Association’s Founders award. This time it’s not funny, it’s just sad. 
   
Here’s Wikipedia on simulated annealing:
  
By analogy with this physical process, each step of the SA algorithm replaces the current solution by a random “nearby” solution, chosen with a probability that depends on the difference between the corresponding function values and on a global parameter T (called the temperature), that is gradually decreased during the process. The dependency is such that the current solution changes almost randomly when T is large, but increasingly “downhill” as T goes to zero. The allowance for “uphill” moves saves the method from becoming stuck at local minima—which are the bane of greedier methods.
  
And here’s Wegman:
  
During each step of the algorithm, the variable that will eventually represent the minimum is replaced by a random solution that is chosen according to a temperature</p><p>3 0.95920992 <a title="902-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2014/andrew_gelman_stats-2014-05-30-I_posted_this_as_a_comment_on_a_sociology_blog.html">2353 andrew gelman stats-2014-05-30-I posted this as a comment on a sociology blog</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I discussed two problems:
 
1.  An artificial scarcity applied to journal publication, a scarcity which I believe is being enforced based on a monetary principle of not wanting to reduce the value of publication.  The problem is that journals don’t just spread information and improve communication, they also represent chits for hiring and promotion.  I’d prefer to separate these two aspects of publication. To keep these functions tied together seems to me like a terrible mistake.  It would be as if, instead of using dollar bills as currency, we were to just use  paper , and then if the government kept paper artificially scarce to retain the value of money, so that we were reduced to scratching notes to each other on walls and tables.
 
2.  The discontinuous way in which unpublished papers and submissions to journals are taken as highly suspect and requiring a strong justification of all methods and assumptions, but once a paper becomes published its conclusions are taken as true unless</p><p>4 0.95680928 <a title="902-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-02-15-With_a_bit_of_precognition%2C_you%E2%80%99d_have_known_I_was_going_to_post_again_on_this_topic%2C_and_with_a_lot_of_precognition%2C_you%E2%80%99d_have_known_I_was_going_to_post_today.html">576 andrew gelman stats-2011-02-15-With a bit of precognition, you’d have known I was going to post again on this topic, and with a lot of precognition, you’d have known I was going to post today</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Masse points me to  this response  by Daryl Bem and two statisticians (Jessica Utts and Wesley Johnson) to criticisms by Wagenmakers et.al. of Bem’s recent ESP study.  I have nothing to add but would like to repeat a couple bits of my discussions of last month, of  here :
  
Classical statistical methods that work reasonably well when studying moderate or large effects (see the work of Fisher, Snedecor, Cochran, etc.) fall apart in the presence of small effects.


I think it’s naive when people implicitly assume that the study’s claims are correct, or the study’s statistical methods are weak. Generally, the smaller the effects you’re studying, the better the statistics you need. ESP is a field of small effects and so ESP researchers use high-quality statistics.


To put it another way: whatever methodological errors happen to be in the paper in question, probably occur in lots of researcher papers in “legitimate” psychology research. The difference is that when you’re studying a</p><p>5 0.95365858 <a title="902-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-08-Gratuitous_use_of_%E2%80%9CBayesian_Statistics%2C%E2%80%9D_a_branding_issue%3F.html">133 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-08-Gratuitous use of “Bayesian Statistics,” a branding issue?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m on an island in Maine for a few weeks (big shout out for North Haven!)  This morning I picked up a copy of “Working Waterfront,” a newspaper that focuses on issues of coastal fishing communities.  I came across  an article  about modeling “fish” populations — actually lobsters, I guess they’re considered “fish” for regulatory purposes.  When I read it, I thought “wow, this article is really well-written, not dumbed down like articles in most newspapers.” I think it’s great that a small coastal newspaper carries reporting like this. (The online version has a few things that I don’t recall in the print version, too, so it’s even better).  But in addition to being struck by finding such a good article in a small newspaper, I was struck by this:
  
According to [University of Maine scientist Yong] Chen, there are four main areas where his model improved on the prior version. “We included the inshore trawl data from Maine and other state surveys, in addition to federal survey data; we h</p><p>6 0.95195514 <a title="902-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-03-27-%E2%80%9CTwo_Dogmas_of_Strong_Objective_Bayesianism%E2%80%9D.html">1779 andrew gelman stats-2013-03-27-“Two Dogmas of Strong Objective Bayesianism”</a></p>

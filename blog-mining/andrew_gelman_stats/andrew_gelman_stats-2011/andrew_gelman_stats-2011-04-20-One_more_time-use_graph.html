I hate this graph.  OK, sure, I don’t hate hate hate hate it:  it’s not a 3-d exploding pie chart or anything.  It’s not misleading, it’s just extremely difficult to read.  Basically, you have to go back and forth between the colors and the labels and the countries and read it like a table.  OK, so here’s the table:

           Work,   Unpaid  Eating, Personal

<p>Introduction: We haven’t had one of these in awhile, having mostly switched to the “chess trivia” and “bad p-values” genres of blogging . . .
 
But I had to come back to the topic after receiving this note from Raghuveer Parthasarathy:
  
 Here’s  another bad graph you might like.  It might (arguably) be even worse than the “worst graphs of the year” you’ve blogged about, since rather than being a poor representation of data, it is simply the plotting of a tautology that mistakenly gives the impression of being data.  (And it’s in Nature.)
  
 
 
Parthasarathy explains:
  
On the vertical axis we have the probability of being Type 2 Diabetic (T2D). On the horizontal axis we have the probability of being normal. There’s a clear, important trend evident, right? No! The probability of being normal is trivially one minus the probability of being T2D! The graph could not possibly be anything other than a straight line of slope -1.

Some of my coworkers at Facebook and I have worked with Udacity to create an online course on exploratory data analysis, including using data visualizations in R as part of EDA.


The course has now launched at  https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651  so anyone can take it for free. And Kaiser Fung has  reviewed it . So definitely feel free to promote it! Criticism is also welcome (we are still fine-tuning things and adding more notes throughout).


I wrote some more comments about the course  here , including highlighting the interviews with my great coworkers.
  
I didn’t have a chance to look at the course so instead I responded with some generic comments about eda and visualization  (in no particular order):

<p>Introduction: Details matter (at least, they do for me), but we don’t yet have a systematic way of going back and forth between the structure of a graph, its details, and the underlying questions that motivate our visualizations.  (Cleveland, Wilkinson, and others have written a bit on how to formalize these connections, and I’ve thought about it too, but we have a ways to go.)
 
I was thinking about this difficulty after reading an article on graphics by some computer scientists that was well-written but to me lacked a feeling for the linkages between substantive/statistical goals and graphical details.  I have problems with these issues too, and my point here is not to criticize but to  move the discussion forward.
 
 When thinking about visualization, how important are the details?

<p>Introduction: Denis Cote sends the  following , under the heading, “Some bad graphs for your enjoyment”:
 
 
 
To start with, they don’t know how to spell “color.”  Seriously, though, the graph is a mess.  The circular display implies a circular or periodic structure that isn’t actually in the data, the cramped display requires the use of an otherwise-unnecessary color code that makes it difficult to find or make sense of the information, the alphabetical ordering (without even supplying state names, only abbreviations) makes it further difficult to find any patterns.  It would be so much better, and even easier, to just display a set of small maps shading states on whether they have different laws.  But that’s part of the problem—the clearer graph would also be easier to make!  To get a distinctive graph, there needs to be some degree of difficulty.
 
The designers continue with these monstrosities:

<p>Introduction: They didn’t have room for  all four graphs  of the time-series decomposition so they just  displayed  the date-of-year graph:
 
 
 
They rotated so the graph fit better on the page.  The rotation worked for me, but I was a bit bummed that that they put the title and heading of the graph (“The birthrate tends to drop on holidays . . .”) on the left in the Mar-Apr slot, leaving no room to label Leap Day and April Fool’s.  I suggested to the graphics people that they put the label at the very top and just shrink the rest of the graph by 5 or 10% so as to not take up any more total space.  Then there’d be plenty of space to label Leap Day and April Fool’s.  But they didn’t do it, maybe they felt that it wouldn’t look good to have the label right at the top, I dunno.</p><p>4 0.8827076 <a title="671-lsi-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-01-04-Cash_in%2C_cash_out_graph.html">502 andrew gelman stats-2011-01-04-Cash in, cash out graph</a></p>

I thought  this graph  [from Ed Easterling] might be good for your blog.


The 71 outlined squares show the main story, and the regions of the graph present the information nicely.


Looks like the bins for the color coding are not of equal size and of course the end bins are unbounded.  Might be interesting to graph the distribution of the actual data for the 71 outlined squares.   In addition, I assume that each period begins on Jan 1 so data size could be naturally increased by looking at intervals that start on June 1 as well (where the limit of this process would be to have it at the granularity of one day; while it most likely wouldn’t make much difference, I’ve seen some graphs before where 1 year returns can be quite sensitive to starting date, etc).
  
I agree that (a) the graph could be improved in small ways–in particular, adding half-year data seems like a great idea–and (b) it’s a wonderful, wonderful graph as is.

<p>Introduction: Under the subject line “Blog bait!”, Brendan Nyhan points me to  this  post at the Washington Post blog:
  
For 2013, we asked some of the year’s most interesting, important and influential thinkers to name their favorite graph of the year — and why they chose it. Here’s Bill Gates’s.

“I love this graph because it shows that while the number of people dying from communicable diseases is still far too high, those numbers continue to come down. . . .”
  
As Brendan is aware, this is not my favorite sort of graph, it’s a bit of a puzzle to read and figure out where all the pieces fit in, also weird stuff going on like 3-D effects and the big space taken up by those yellow and green borders, as well as tricky things like understanding what some of those little blocks are, and perhaps the biggest question, what is the definition of an “untimely death.”  But, as often is the case, the defects of the graph form a statistical perspective can</p><p>6 0.86879569 <a title="671-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-The_R_code_for_those_time-use_graphs.html">672 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-The R code for those time-use graphs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: OK, here’s something that is completely baffling me.  I read  this article  by John Colapinto on the neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran, who’s famous for his innovative treatment for “phantom limb” pain:
  
His first subject was a young man who a decade earlier had crashed his motorcycle and torn from his spinal column the nerves supplying the left arm.  After keeping the useless arm in a sling for a year, the man had the arm amputated above the elbow.  Ever since, he had felt unremitting cramping in the phantom limb, as though it were immobilized in an awkward position. . . . Ramachandram positioned a twenty-inch-by-twenty-inch drugstore mirror . . . and told him to place his intact right arm on one side of the mirror and his stump on the other.  He told the man to arrange the mirror so that the reflection created the illusion that his intact arm was the continuation of the amputated one.  The Ramachandran asked the man to move his right and left arms . . . “Oh, my God!” the man began</p><p>2 0.91160148 <a title="671-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-08-30-A_Stan_is_Born.html">1475 andrew gelman stats-2012-08-30-A Stan is Born</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stan 1.0.0 and RStan 1.0.0 
 
It’s official.  The Stan Development Team is happy to announce the first stable versions of Stan and RStan.  
 
 What is (R)Stan? 
 
Stan is an open-source package for obtaining Bayesian inference using the No-U-Turn sampler, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  It’s sort of like BUGS, but with a different language for expressing models and a different sampler for sampling from their posteriors. 
 
RStan is the R interface to Stan.  
 
 Stan Home Page 
 
Stan’s home page is:     http://mc-stan.org/    
 
It links everything you need to get started running Stan from the command line, from R, or from C++, including full step-by-step install instructions, a detailed user’s guide and reference manual for the modeling language, and tested ports of most of the BUGS examples.
 
 Peruse the Manual 
 
If you’d like to learn more, the   Stan User’s Guide and Reference Manual   is the place to start.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.88217056 <a title="671-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-04-20-One_more_time-use_graph.html">671 andrew gelman stats-2011-04-20-One more time-use graph</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Evan Hensleigh sens me this redesign of  the cross-national time use graph :
 
   
 
Here was my version:
 
   
 
And here was the original:
 
 
 
Compared to my graph, Evan’s has better fonts, and that’s important–good fonts can make a display look professional.  But I’m not sure about his other innovations.  To me, the different colors for the different time-use categories are more of a distraction than a visual aid, and I also don’t like how he made the bars fatter.  As I noted in my earlier entry, to me this draws unwanted attention to the negative space between the bars.  His country labels are slightly misaligned (particularly Japan and USA), and I really don’t like his horizontal axis at all!  He removed the units of hours and put + and – on the edges so that the axes run into each other.  What was the point of that?  It’s bad news.  Also I don’t see any advantage  at all  to the prehensile tick marks.  On the other hand, if Evgn and I were working together on such a graph, we w</p><p>4 0.8804664 <a title="671-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-07-23-Special_effects.html">1426 andrew gelman stats-2012-07-23-Special effects</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The above is the title of  a talk  that Thad Tarpey gave at the Joint Statistical Meetings in 2009.  Here’s the abstract:
  
Students of statistics are often introduced to George Box’s famous quote: “all models are wrong, some are useful.” In this talk I [Tarpey] argue that this quote, although useful, is wrong. A different and more positive perspective is to acknowledge that a model is simply a means of extracting information of interest from data. The truth is infinitely complex and a model is merely an approximation to the truth. If the approximation is poor or misleading, then the model is useless. In this talk I give examples of correct models that are not true models. I illustrate how the notion of a “wrong” model can lead to wrong conclusions.
  
I’m curious what he had to say—maybe he could post the slides?

<p>Introduction: After learning of a  news article  by Amy Harmon on problems with medical trials–sometimes people are stuck getting the placebo when they could really use the experimental treatment, and it can be a life-or-death difference, John Langford  discusses  some fifteen-year-old work on optimal design in machine learning and makes the following completely reasonable point:
  
With reasonable record keeping of existing outcomes for the standard treatments, there is no need to explicitly assign people to a control group with the standard treatment, as that approach is effectively explored with great certainty. Asserting otherwise would imply that the nature of effective treatments for cancer has changed between now and a year ago, which denies the value of any clinical trial. . . .


Done the right way, the clinical trial for a successful treatment would start with some initial small pool (equivalent to “phase 1″ in the article) and then simply expanded the pool of participants over time as it</p><p>5 0.12010129 <a title="747-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-05-03-New_New_York_data_research_organizations.html">1297 andrew gelman stats-2012-05-03-New New York data research organizations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a single day, New York City obtained two data analysis/statistics/machine learning organizations:
  
  Microsoft Research  New York City with  John Langford  (machine learning),  Duncan Watts  (networks), and  Dave Pennock  (algorithmic economics). 
  eBay technology center  focusing on data – led by  Chris Dixon , the co-founder of the recommendation engine company Hunch, which has recently been acquired by eBay. 
  
New York already has Facebook’s engineering  unit , Twitter’s East Coast  headquarters , and Google’s  second-largest  engineering office.
 
The data community here is on an upswing, and it might be one of the best places to be if you’re into applied statistics, machine learning or data analysis.

<p>Introduction: After reading  this  from John Langford:
  
The Deep Learning problem remains interesting. How do you effectively learn complex nonlinearities capable of better performance than a basic linear predictor? An effective solution avoids feature engineering. Right now, this is almost entirely dealt with empirically, but theory could easily have a role to play in phrasing appropriate optimization algorithms, for example.
  
Jimmy asks:
  
Does this sound related to modeling the deep interactions you often talk about?  (I [Jimmy] never understand the stuff on hunch, but thought that might be so?)
  
My reply:  I don’t understand that stuff on hunch so well either–he uses slightly different jargon than I do!  That said, it looks interesting and important so I’m pointing you all to it.</p><p>2 0.95011723 <a title="747-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-04-21-Value-added_assessment_political_FAIL.html">1274 andrew gelman stats-2012-04-21-Value-added assessment political FAIL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jimmy points me to a  sequence of posts  (Analyzing Released NYC Value-Added Data Parts 1, 2, 3, 4) by Gary Rubinstein slamming value-added assessment of teachers.
 
A skeptical consensus seems to have arisen on this issue.  The teachers groups don’t like the numbers and it seems like none of the reformers trust the numbers enough to defend them.  Lots of people like the  idea  of evaluating teacher performance, but I don’t see anybody out there wanting to seriously defend the numbers that are being pushed out here.
 
P.S.  Just to be clear, I’m specifically addressing the problems arising in value assessment of individual teachers.  I’m not criticizing the interesting research by Jonah Rockoff and others on the distribution of teacher effects.  It’s a lot easier to estimate the distribution of a set of parameters than to estimate the parameters individually.</p><p>3 0.94846326 <a title="747-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-27-The_Three_Golden_Rules_for_Successful_Scientific_Research.html">166 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-27-The Three Golden Rules for Successful Scientific Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A famous computer scientist, Edsger W. Dijkstra, was writing short memos on a daily basis for most of his life. His memo  archives  contains a little over 1300 memos. I guess today he would be writing a blog, although his memos do tend to be slightly more profound than what I post.
 
Here are the  rules  (follow link for commentary), which I tried to summarize:
  
  Pursue quality and challenge, avoid routine.  (“Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward.”) 
  When pursuing social relevance, never compromise on scientific soundness.  (“We all like our work to be socially relevant and scientifically sound. If we can find a topic satisfying both desires, we are lucky; if the two targets are in conflict with each other, let the requirement of scientific sou</p><p>4 0.93900895 <a title="747-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-18-%E2%80%9CI_was_finding_the_test_so_irritating_and_boring_that_I_just_started_to_click_through_as_fast_as_I_could%E2%80%9D.html">351 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-18-“I was finding the test so irritating and boring that I just started to click through as fast as I could”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  this article , Oliver Sacks talks about his extreme difficulty in recognizing people (even close friends) and places (even extremely familiar locations such as his apartment and his office).
 
After reading this, I started to wonder if I have a very mild case of face-blindness.  I’m very good at recognizing places, but I’m not good at faces.  And I can’t really visualize faces at all.  Like Sacks and some of his correspondents, I often have to do it by cheating, by recognizing certain landmarks that I can remember, thus coding the face linguistically rather than visually.  (On the other hand, when thinking about mathematics or statistics, I’m very visual, as readers of this blog can attest.)
  

 
Anyway, in searching for the link to Sacks’s article, I came across the “ Cambridge Face Memory Test .”
 
My reaction when taking this test was mostly irritation.  I just found it annoying to stare at all these unadorned faces, and in my attempt to memorize them, I was trying to use trick</p><p>5 0.9377867 <a title="747-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-06-16-Evilicious%3A_Why_We_Evolved_a_Taste_for_Being_Bad.html">1901 andrew gelman stats-2013-06-16-Evilicious: Why We Evolved a Taste for Being Bad</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The other day, a friend told me that when he saw me blogging on Noam Chomsky, he was surprised not to see any mention of disgraced primatologist Marc Hauser.  I was like, whaaaaaa?  I had no idea these two had any connection.  In fact, though, they wrote papers together.
 
This made me wonder what Chomsky thought of Hauser’s data scandal.  I googled *marc hauser noam chomsky* and the first item that came up was this, from July 2011, reported by Tom Bartlett:
  
I [Bartlett] asked Chomsky for his comment on the Hauser resignation and he e-mailed the following:

 
Mark Hauser is a fine scientist with an outstanding record of accomplishment. His resignation is a serious loss for Harvard, and given the nature of the attack on him, for science generally.
 
  
Chomsky is a mentor of Hauser so I can’t fault Chomsky for defending the guy.  But why couldn’t he have stuck with something more general, something like, “I respect and admire Mark Hauser and am not aware of any improprieties in his w</p><p>6 0.92985535 <a title="747-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2013/andrew_gelman_stats-2013-08-20-Job_opening_at_an_organization_that_promotes_reproducible_research%21.html">1990 andrew gelman stats-2013-08-20-Job opening at an organization that promotes reproducible research!</a></p>

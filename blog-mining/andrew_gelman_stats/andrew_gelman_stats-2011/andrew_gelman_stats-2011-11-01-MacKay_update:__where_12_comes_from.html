<p>Introduction: I’ve recently been reading David MacKay’s 2003  book , Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms. It’s great background for my Bayesian computation class because he has lots of pictures and detailed discussions of the algorithms.  (Regular readers of this blog will not be surprised to hear that I hate all the  Occam -factor stuff that MacKay talks about, but overall it’s a great book.)
 
Anyway, I happened to notice the following bit, under the heading, “How many samples are needed?”:
  
In many problems, we really only need about twelve independent samples from P(x). Imagine that x is an unknown vector such as the amount of corrosion present in each of 10 000 underground pipelines around Cambridge, and φ(x) is the total cost of repairing those pipelines. The distribution P(x) describes the probability of a state x given the tests that have been carried out on some pipelines and the assumptions about the physics of corrosion. The quantity Φ is the expected cost of the repa</p><p>3 0.13866298 <a title="986-tfidf-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-14-Missed_Friday_the_13th_Zombie_Plot_Update.html">710 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-14-Missed Friday the 13th Zombie Plot Update</a></p>

And just the history part from my thesis – that some find interesting. 
(And to provide a selfish wiki meta-analysis entry pointer)

I have had about a dozen friends read this or earlier versions – they split into finding it interesting (and pragmatic) versus incomprehensible. 
 
The reason for that may or may not point to ways to make it clearer.

<p>Introduction: In my comments on David MacKay’s 2003 book on Bayesian inference, I  wrote  that I hate all the Occam-factor stuff that MacKay talks about, and I linked to  this quote  from Radford Neal:
  
Sometimes a simple model will outperform a more complex model . . . Nevertheless, I believe that deliberately limiting the complexity of the model is not fruitful when the problem is evidently complex. Instead, if a simple model is found that outperforms some particular complex model, the appropriate response is to define a different complex model that captures whatever aspect of the problem led to the simple model performing well.
  
MacKay replied as follows:
  
When you said you disagree with me on Occam factors I think what you meant was that you agree with me on them.  I’ve read your post on the topic and completely agreed with you (and Radford) that we should be using models the size of a  house, models that we believe in, and that anyone who thinks it is a good idea to  bias the model toward</p><p>5 0.084102154 <a title="986-tfidf-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-11-14-%E2%80%9CFree_energy%E2%80%9D_and_economic_resources.html">1010 andrew gelman stats-2011-11-14-“Free energy” and economic resources</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By “free energy” I don’t mean perpetual motion machines, cars that run on water and get 200 mpg, or the latest cold-fusion hype.
 
No, I’m referring to the term from physics.  The free energy of a system is, roughly, the amount of energy that can be directly extracted from it.  For example, a rock at room temperature is just  full  of energy—not just the energy locked in its nuclei, but basic thermal energy—but at room temperature you can’t extract any of it.
 
To the physicists in the audience:  Yes, I realize that free energy has a technical meaning in statistical mechanics and that my above definition is sloppy.  Please bear with me.  And, to the non-physicists:  feel free to head to Wikipedia or a physics textbook for a more careful treatment.
 
I was thinking about free energy the other day when hearing someone on the radio say something about China bailing out the E.U.  I did a double-take.  Huh?  The E.U. is rich, China’s not so rich.  How can a middle-income country bail out a</p><p>6 0.082036808 <a title="986-tfidf-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-06-13-Economists_._._..html">1378 andrew gelman stats-2012-06-13-Economists . . .</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Psychology researcher Chris Chabris  writes :
  
Rolf Dobelli, a Swiss writer, published a book called The Art of Thinking Clearly earlier this year with HarperCollins in the U.S. The book’s original German edition was a #1 bestseller, and the book has sold over one million copies worldwide.


In perusing Mr. Dobelli’s book, we noticed several familiar-sounding passages. On closer examination, we found five instances of unattributed material that is either reproduced verbatim or closely paraphrased from text and arguments in our book, The Invisible Gorilla (Crown, 2010). They are listed at the end of this note.
  
Apparently he ripped off Nassim Taleb  too .
 
A million copies, huh?  I guess crime really does pay!  Maybe he could get an appointment at  Harvard Law School  or, if that falls through, a position as writer-in-residence at the statistics department of George Mason University [no link needed for that one -- ed.].

<p>Introduction: In her essay on Margaret Mitchell and Gone With the Wind, Claudia Roth Pierpoint writes:
  
The much remarked “readability” of the book must have played a part in this smooth passage from the page to the screen, since “readability” has to do not only with freedom from obscurity but, paradoxically, with  freedom from the actual sensation of reading  [emphasis added]—of the tug and traction of words as they move thoughts into place in the mind.  Requiring, in fact, the least reading, the most “readable” book allows its characters to slip easily through nets of words and into other forms.  Popular art has been well defined by just this effortless movement from medium to medium, which is carried out, as Leslie Fiedler observed in relation to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, “without loss of intensity or alteration of meaning.”  Isabel Archer rises from the page only in the hanging garments of Henry James’s prose, but Scarlett O’Hara is a free woman.

<p>Introduction: Some clarification on the Bayes-in-China issue raised  last week :
 
1.  We heard that the Chinese publisher cited the following pages that might contain politically objectionable materials:  3, 5, 21, 73, 112, 201.
 
2.  It appears that, as some commenters suggested, the objection was to some of the applications, not to the Bayesian methods.
 
3.  Our book is not censored in China.  In fact, as some commenters mentioned, it is possible to buy it there, and it is also available in university libraries there.  The edition of the book which was canceled was intended to be a low-cost reprint of the book.  The original book is still available.  I used the phrase “Banned in China” as a joke and I apologize if it was misinterpreted.
 
4.  I have no quarrel with the Chinese government or with any Chinese publishers.  They can publish whatever books they would like.  I found this episode amusing only because I do not think my book on regression and multilevel models has any strong political co</p><p>6 0.79155415 <a title="986-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-28-New_book_by_Stef_van_Buuren_on_missing-data_imputation_looks_really_good%21.html">1642 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-28-New book by Stef van Buuren on missing-data imputation looks really good!</a></p>

You said that can imagine rounding up 9 to 10 – which would be elegant if we worked in base 10.


But in the UK we haven’t switched to base 10 yet, we still work in  dozens and grosses.  (One gross = 12^2 = 144.)  So I was taught (by John Skilling, probably) “a dozen samples are plenty”. 


Probably in an earlier draft of the book in 2001 I said “a dozen”, rather than “12″.  Then some feedbacker may have written and said “I don’t know what a dozen is”;  so then I sacrificed elegant language and replaced “dozen” by “12″, which  leads to your mystification. 


PS – please send the winner of your competition a free copy of my other book ( sewtha ) too, from me. 


PPS I see that Mikkel Schmidt [in your comments] has diligently found the correct answer, which I guessed above. I suggest you award the prizes to him.
  
OK, we’re just  giving  away books here!

<p>Introduction: Robert Birkelbach:
  
I am writing my Bachelor Thesis in which I want to assess the reading competencies of German elementary school children using the PIRLS2006 data. My levels are classrooms and the individuals. However, my dependent variable is a multiple imputed (m=5) reading test. The problem I have is, that I do not know, whether I can just calculate 5 linear multilevel models and then average all the results (the coefficients, standard deviation, bic, intra class correlation, R2, t-statistics, p-values etc) or if I need different formulas for integrating the results of the five models into one because it is a multilevel analysis? Do you think there’s a better way in solving my problem? I would greatly appreciate if you could help me with a problem regarding my analysis — I am quite a newbie to multilevel modeling and especially to multiple imputation. Also: Is it okay to use frequentist models when the multiple imputation was done bayesian? Would the different philosophies of sc</p><p>3 0.91802001 <a title="986-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-09-07-QB2.html">260 andrew gelman stats-2010-09-07-QB2</a></p>

Saw  you had a post  on the research I did with Rob Simmons on the NFL draft.  I have attached the article.  This article has not officially been published, so please don’t post this on-line.


The post you linked to states the following:   “On his blog, Berri says he restricts the analysis to QBs who have played more than 500 downs, or for 5 years. He also looks at per-play statistics, like touchdowns per game, to counter what he considers an opportunity bias.”


Two points:  First of all, we did not look at touchdowns per game (that is not a per play stat).  More importantly —  as this post indicates  — we did far more than just look at data after five years. 


We did mention the five year result, but directly below that discussion (and I mean, directly below), the following sentences appear.

 
Our data set runs from 1970 to 2007 (adjustments were made for how performance changed over time). We also looked at career performance after 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 years</p><p>4 0.91617954 <a title="986-lda-4" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-05-16-%E2%80%9CIt_doesn%E2%80%99t_matter_if_you_believe_in_God.__What_matters_is_if_God_believes_in_you.%E2%80%9D.html">715 andrew gelman stats-2011-05-16-“It doesn’t matter if you believe in God.

<p>Introduction: Mark Chaves sent me  this great article  on religion and religious practice:
  
After reading a book or article in the scientific study of religion, I [Chaves] wonder if you ever find yourself thinking, “I just don’t believe it.” I have this experience uncomfortably often, and I think it’s because of a pervasive problem in the scientific study of religion. I want to describe that problem and how to overcome it.


The problem is illustrated in a story told by Meyer Fortes. He once asked a rainmaker in 
a native culture he was studying to perform the rainmaking ceremony for him. The rainmaker refused, replying: “Don’t be a fool, whoever makes a rain-making ceremony in the dry season?”


The problem is illustrated in a different way in a story told by Jay Demerath. He was in Israel, visiting friends for a Sabbath dinner. The man of the house, a conservative rabbi, stopped in the middle of chanting the prayers to say cheerfully: “You know, we don’t believe in any of this. But then in Judai</p><p>5 0.90770298 <a title="986-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-10-13-Battle_of_the_NYT_opinion-page_economists.html">339 andrew gelman stats-2010-10-13-Battle of the NYT opinion-page economists</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Meow! 
 
Wow–economists are under a lot of pressure.  Not only do they have to keep publishing after they get tenure; they have to be funny, too!  It’s a lot easier in statistics and political science.  Nobody expects us to be funny, so any little witticism always gets a big laugh.
 
P.S.  I think no one will deny that Levitt has a sense of humor.  For example, he ran  this item  with a straight face, relaying to NYT readers in October 2008 that “the current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming.”
 
P.P.S.  I think  this  will keep me safe for awhile.</p><p>6 0.89561379 <a title="986-lda-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2010/andrew_gelman_stats-2010-07-20-Burglars_are_local.html">156 andrew gelman stats-2010-07-20-Burglars are local</a></p>

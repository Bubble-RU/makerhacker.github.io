Just about anyone’s that’s been in the tech game thinks patents are ridiculous.

<p>Introduction: Duncan Watts gave  his new book  the above title, reflecting his irritation with those annoying people who, upon hearing of the latest social science research, reply with:  Duh-I-knew-that.  (I don’t know how to say Duh in Australian; maybe someone can translate that for me?)  I, like Duncan, am easily irritated, and I looked forward to reading the book.  I enjoyed it a lot, even though it has only one graph, and that graph has a problem with its y-axis.  (OK, the book also has two diagrams and a graph of fake data, but that doesn’t count.)
 
Before going on, let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with Duncan’s central point:  social science research findings are often surprising, but the best results cause us to rethink our world in such a way that they seem completely obvious, in retrospect.  (Don Rubin used to tell us that there’s no such thing as a “paradox”:  once you fully understand a phenomenon, it should not seem paradoxical any more.

<p>Introduction: A few months ago, in response to some reflections from Steve Hsu, I  wrote  the following:
  
I’ve long been glad that when I went to college in the 80s, I was at MIT rather than Harvard. Either place I would’ve taken hard classes and learned a lot, but one advantage of MIT was that we had no sense–no sense at all–that we could make big bucks. We had no sense of making moderately big bucks as lawyers, no sense of making big bucks working on Wall Street, and no sense of making really big bucks by starting a business. I mean, sure, we knew about lawyers (but we didn’t know that a lawyer with technical skills would be a killer combination), we knew about Wall Street (but we had no idea what they did, other than shout pork belly prices across a big room), and we knew about tech startups (but we had no idea that they were anything to us beyond a source of jobs for engineers).

<p>Introduction: Christian Robert points to  this  absurd patent of the Monte Carlo method (which, as Christian notes, was actually invented by Stanislaw Ulam and others in the 1940s).
 
The whole thing is pretty unreadable.  I wonder if they first wrote it as a journal article and then it got rejected everywhere, so they decided to submit it as a patent instead.
 
What’s even worse is this bit:
  
This invention was made with government support under Grant Numbers 0612170 and 0347408 awarded by the National Science Foundation.
  
So our tax dollars are being given to IBM so they can try to bring statistics to a halt by patenting one of our most basic tools?  I’d say this is just a waste of money, but given that our country is run by lawyers, there must be some outside chance that this patent could actually succeed?
 
Perhaps there’s room for an improvement in the patent that involves  albedo  in some way?</p><p>6 0.65439034 <a title="626-lsi-6" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2012/andrew_gelman_stats-2012-12-20-Who_exactly_are_those_silly_academics_who_aren%E2%80%99t_as_smart_as_a_Vegas_bookie%3F.html">1632 andrew gelman stats-2012-12-20-Who exactly are those silly academics who aren’t as smart as a Vegas bookie?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Readers of  this  bizarre story (in which a dubious claim about reflectivity of food in cooking transmuted into a flat-out wrong claim about the relevance of reflectivity of solar panels) might wonder how genius Nathan Myhrvold (Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Princeton at age 24, postdoc with Stephen Hawking for chrissake) could make such a basic mistake.
 
In an earlier comment, I  dismissed  this with a flip allusion to Wile E. Coyote.  But now I’m thinking there’s something more going on.
 
In our blog discussion (see links above), Phil is surprised I didn’t take a stronger stance on the albedo issue after reading Pierrehumbert’s explanation.  Phil asks:  Why did I write “experts seem to think the albedo effect is a red herring” instead of something stronger such as, “as Pierrehumbert shows in detail, the albedo effect is a red herring”?
 
I didn’t do this because my physics credentials are no better than Myhrvold’s.  And, given that Myhrvold got it wrong, I don’t completely trus</p><p>2 0.96000868 <a title="626-lda-2" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-12-28-%E2%80%9C._._._extending_for_dozens_of_pages%E2%80%9D.html">1090 andrew gelman stats-2011-12-28-“. . . extending for dozens of pages”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kaiser  writes :
  
I have read a fair share of bore-them-to-tears compilation of survey research results – you know, those presentations with one multi-colored, stacked or grouped bar chart after another, extending for dozens of pages.
  
I hate those grouped bar charts also—as I’ve written repeatedly, the central role of almost all statistical displays is to make comparisons, and you can make twice as many comparisons with a line plot as a bar plot.
 
But I suspect the real problem with the reports that Kaiser is talking about is the “extending for dozens of pages” part.  If they could just print each individual plot smaller and put dozens on a page, you could maybe get through the whole report in two or three pages.  Almost always, graphs are too large.  I’ve even seen abominations such as a fifty-page report with a single huge pie chart on each page.
 
As Kaiser says, think about communication!  A report with one big pie chart or bar plot per page is like a text document with one w</p><p>3 0.9571349 <a title="626-lda-3" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-03-23-My_last_post_on_albedo%2C_I_promise.html">625 andrew gelman stats-2011-03-23-My last post on albedo, I promise</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After seeing my recent  blogs  on Nathan Myhrvold, a friend told me that, in the tech world, the albedo-obsessed genius is known as a patent troll.
 
Really?
 
Yup.  My friend writes:
  
 
It’s perhaps indicative that Myhrvold comes up in the top-ten hits on Google for [patent troll]. These blog posts lay it out pretty clearly:

Just about anyone’s that’s been in the tech game thinks patents are ridiculous.  The lab where I used to work wanted us to create an “intellectual mine field” in our field so the companycould block anyone from entering the space.  Yes, we made stuff, but the patents were for totally obvious ideas that anyone would have.

<p>Introduction: Last month a history professor sent me a note regarding plagiarism at Arizona State University:
  
Matthew Whitaker, who had received an expedited promotion to full professor and was made Director of a new Center for the Study of Race and Democracy by Provost Elizabeth Capaldi and President Michael Crow, was charged by most of the full professors in the History Faculty with having plagiarized throughout his corpus of work, copying from regular works of scholarship and from web sources. Indeed, in his response, which claimed that the petitioners were racist, Whitaker admitted to plagiarism in his work, defending himself in part by stating that he had not reviewed carefully the research and writing he had hired others to do. . . .
  
What bothered my correspondent was that Whitaker remains an ASU Foundation Professor of History despite all the plaig. According to Whitaker’s  webpage , he “is also a highly sought after speaker, having offered commentaries on NPR, PBS, . . . and other medi</p><p>5 0.95487738 <a title="626-lda-5" href="../andrew_gelman_stats-2011/andrew_gelman_stats-2011-10-20-A_qualified_but_incomplete_thanks_to_Gregg_Easterbrook%E2%80%99s_editor_at_Reuters.html">966 andrew gelman stats-2011-10-20-A qualified but incomplete thanks to Gregg Easterbrook’s editor at Reuters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dear Reuters editor:
 
Thanks for reading  my blog  and correcting the erroneous numbers in Easterbrook’s  column  from the other day.
 
I’m pretty sure you got the corrections from my blog because in your corrections you used  the exact same links  that I posted.  I think your readers will like that you gave links to the sources of your numbers.
 
But I’d appreciate if you cite me!  It’s considered polite to credit your sources rather than just copying over numbers and links with no mention of where they came from.  Unlike Easterbrook, I’m not expecting to be paid for this material but I’d still like to be thanked.
 
(See the last paragraph of  this post  by Felix Salmon for more on the desirability of linking to your sources.)
 
Also, since you’re correcting the article anyway, maybe you could go back and change this sentence too:
  
But don’t sell Huntsman short because he is low in the polls – Obama had been at that point, too.
  
As I noted earlier,
